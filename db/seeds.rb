More importantly, should you be?", description: "<h5><span style=\"color: #800000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Back in the day - before the Internet, before Recruiters, when there was less choice - workers were company loyal. They stuck around, gave 30 years’ service, got gold watches. There are pros and cons to this, but the information age has definitely changed this behaviour by providing greater visibility of alternatives and greater access to change.</span></h5>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><!--more--></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Despite the wealth of information, opportunities, recruiters chasing and cajoling, the average candidate still contemplates a move for 6+ months prior to the straw that breaks the camel’s back, then taking a further 4 months to secure a role. That’s nearly a year spent in some degree of dissatisfaction. Below is a list that might help to assess whether you are happy in your current role, and if today is the right day to step into the job market:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Do you feel challenged?</span></strong> Think back to when the job was new, the learning curve steep. Do you still feel outside of your comfort zone, that you are developing? If not, speak to your manager.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>When your alarm goes off, does it fill you with dread?</strong> </span>Not just on a Monday when it’s raining, but every day? If you don’t look forward to hitting your desk, work out what could make that happen and go for it, either internally or externally.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Do you feel valued?</strong></span> It’s widely accepted that how you feel is more impactful than what you are given. Does your boss thank you for a job well done? Does your work contribute to the bigger picture? If you feel marginalized or out in the cold, you are weeks away from looking externally.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Can you see your next internal opportunity?</strong></span> Does it excite you? If you look at the people above you and dread the idea of becoming them, review your options.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Is your pay commensurate with your effort and skills?</strong> </span>Money is rarely the main driver for a permanent employee, but you do need to feel rewarded for your efforts. If you don’t, address it internally. Failing that, speak to a Specialist Recruiter and benchmark.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>When the inMail comes in from a Recruiter, do you open it immediately?</strong> </span>When you are happy and engaged, you hit the auto-response; “Thanks for thinking of me, but I am not interested.” If you read it, there is a reason you are doing so.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Acid Test – Are you proud to be doing what you do?</strong></span> Not in a Mother Theresa, altruistic way necessarily, but in a way that when you hit your goals, deliver your work, make things happen you feel good about doing so. If not, the rot will set in pretty quickly and worse still, your performance may suffer. Dust off the CV.</span>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; color: #800000;\">Unlike most recruiters, I don’t advocate an external move as the first alternative.

  {title: "Why do people fail at interviews?", description: "<h5><span style=\"color: #800000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">You have the experience. It’s a natural step up for you. You’re really excited. For once, the Recruiter has hit the nail on the head and found you the perfect role. So why do you leave the interview feeling like you missed the mark? Worse still, why did the feedback come back saying that you weren’t quite strong enough?</span></h5>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">There are definite themes in the reasons candidates fall down at interviews, some of which are understandable - and some unforgivable. Here is a selection of the most common and most easily addressed.</span></h5>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><!--more--></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Lack of Research.</span> </strong>As a hiring manager myself, nothing frustrates me more than a candidate who has done less than a modicum of research. With so much information at our fingertips, it is unforgivable to not be able to demonstrate your knowledge of the company, the line manager, news stories, financials etc.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Not knowing your CV.</strong></span> You wrote it. You probably spent hours agonizing over what to include and what to exclude. You may have changed it so often that you need to re-familiarise. It is essential to re-read it before the interview, take a copy with you and have it in front of you. Much better to be over-cautious than caught short.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Not preparing examples of your work in relation to the job at hand.</strong> </span>A wise recruiter from my past taught me that an interview answer always requires an example, regardless of how theoretical the question. More importantly those examples should be structured and have a tangible result. We recommend the STAR approach (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Prepare the examples in advance, drill yourself on them and know them inside out. There is nothing worse than having the experience but failing to convey it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Poor eye contact or body language.</strong></span> There is lots of research on the power of assertiveness, strong handshakes, and strong eye-contact. You don’t need to be Gordon Gekko, but poor performance in these areas can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in an interview situation.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Lack of suitable questions.</strong> </span>Most interviewers want someone to show an interest, have an enquiring mind, and probe. An interview is a two-way dialogue and the quality of your questions will be assessed. Prepare some questions from your research, but also don’t be afraid to make notes in the interview and ask questions that arise as a result.</span>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">This is not an exhaustive list.  However, if you concentrate on doing these basics well, be on time, be engaging and engaged, and structure your answers well with good examples, you will maximize your chances of success. If in doubt, ask your recruiter.

  {title: "Why I Hate Recruiters – By a Recruiter", description: "<h5><span style=\"color: #800000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Recruiters are everywhere, in every market, and much of the time, up in your business. We all know the adjectives that get bandied around about the salesy, greedy, overpaid “Consultants” who are only out to make the placement and get the money, and if you’ve been in the industry for any length of time chances are you could name some of these people. Below are the 5 main reasons I hate recruiters.</span></h5>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><!--more--></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>They just don’t listen.</strong></span> My first recruitment boss told me I had two ears and one mouth for a reason; because I should listen twice as much as I speak. It pains me to listen to recruiters who just talk, talk, talk and sell, sell, sell. It prompts me to ask them difficult questions that I know they won’t have the answer to because they haven’t prepared the call.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">They don’t offer any advice.</span> </strong>The average candidate changes jobs every 3 years. The average hiring manager recruits 4 times per year. The Recruitment Consultant should be the expert. How often do they offer that expertise? How often is the Consultant genuinely consultative? Show knowledge, offer advice, add value!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>They send people stuff that bears no resemblance to what they have asked for.</strong> </span>We recently met with a client who had received 27 CVs from “Recruitment Consultants” who were apparently specialists in the market. Of the 27, 4 were interviewed. 8 CVs to 1 interview!? Really, Recruiters? Your job is to find the right people for the role, not just the best people you currently have or can find on Reed! Earn your fee by finding targeted, scarce resource.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>They try and blag candidates and clients to get leads and market intelligence.</strong> </span>Wake up, recruiters. This is not the 90s. Candidates know why you want to find out where they are interviewing. Be honest! It’s information that makes the network succeed. One candidate’s rejected opportunity is another candidate’s dream role. If everyone oils the wheels, everyone benefits. Just don’t use the information to anyone’s disadvantage.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>They go for the hard close.</strong> </span>There should never be a need for a hard close. If the close is hard, you haven’t done the other work well. If you understand someone’s needs and match them effectively with your offering, the close should be straightforward. Don’t apply loads of pressure - go back, probe, listen, understand, match more effectively and close gently.</span>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Don’t get me wrong. I am proud to have built my recruitment career. I know hundreds of recruiters who work hard, show knowledge, listen, understand, provide what candidates and clients have asked for, and often can’t secure for themselves without expert help. If we could just get the charlatans to move away from the above, the whole market could benefit!</span></h5>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: nil},

With this in mind, the results from our latest Salary Insights report, produced in conjunction with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), are no surprise.</span></h5>\n<!--more-->\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Despite having established careers, the clear majority of professionals are embracing the opportunity to continue their professional development (CPD) – and with good reason.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">At the most basic level, CPD enables professionals to stay relevant and up-to-date with not only ongoing changes in laws and legislation, but also digital advancements and industry trends. Naturally, this helps to advance the body of knowledge within your organisation and the wider profession. While CPD is often most closely associated with professionals who are in the early stages of their careers, the reality is that there is no ceiling to what can be achieved through ongoing training and development.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">There are no strict guidelines regarding how many hours of CPD accounting professionals are required to undertake each year. ICAEW members must sign an annual declaration that they have completed as much development activity as they feel is required to ‘remain competent’ in their role. Similarly, CIMA doesn’t prescribe numbers of hours or units, rather it asks that members do as much as they need to remain ‘professionally competent’ and meet their career goals. However, our data shows that accounting professionals are typically going above and beyond the mandatory requirements, keeping their foot on the accelerator to keep their careers driving forwards.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">According to our research, more than two-thirds of all CIMA members in the UK and Ireland were planning to learn new skills within the next year to aid career progression. What’s more, these professionals appear to be focusing on learning strategic and softer skills, with the most frequently mentioned areas for improvement including:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Strategy (36%)</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Influence (29%)</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Coaching and mentoring (26%)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">These are typically the attributes needed to manage teams, lead departments and contribute to discussions at board level. Clearly, our respondents are an ambitious bunch!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">The truth is that while CPD is a career-long obligation for all practicing professionals, a well-planned CPD strategy safeguards not only your employer, but also your own career. It seems that accountants are increasingly realising that professional development is the key to unlocking new positions where you can lead, manage, consult, influence, coach and mentor others - and those who actively seek out opportunities to broaden their horizons will have the greatest opportunities to excel in their careers.  </span>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/CPD-Accountancy-2.png")},

The Government has pledged to scrap income and capital gains tax relief for shares awarded under Employee Shareholder Status (ESS), just three years after the scheme was introduced, due to evidence suggesting it is mainly being used for tax planning. The Chancellor also announced the removal of tax and NI benefits for salary sacrifice schemes, with the exception of childcare, cycle to work and ultra-low emissions cars schemes and pensions. The Government’s previous pledge to up the personal allowance and higher tax rate threshold still stands.    </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Employer and employee NI thresholds are also due to be aligned – the insurance premium tax will rise to 12% from 10%; while the taxation of people working in different structures is set to be equalised.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Looking at business investment, Hammond announced that an extra £400m would be injected into the British Business Bank to then be placed with venture capital funds. It’s hoped this will unlock £1bn of new finance for growing firms and encourage more to resist the temptation to sell out earlier in search of a big payday.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">One thing the Autumn Statement didn’t offer was an update on the Making Tax Digital consultations, which is unsurprising when you consider that the proposals received over 3,000 responses by the consultation deadline just two short weeks ago. The Government has, however, committed to publishing a response in January. We await the outcome with bated breath.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">While Hammond’s announcement was designed to be pro-business in a time of market uncertainty, only time will tell if it offers financial planners the level of confidence they need to push on with short and medium term strategies for investment. One thing is for certain, there’s enough here to keep management accountants on their toes until the first of next year’s Budget’s this coming spring.</span>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/autmn-statement.png")},

However, while no one is disputing the hard work that goes into crafting these statements, they are absolutely worthless unless they are lived and embodied by your team.</span></h5>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">As the practice of developing corporate values has become more commonplace, it seems that the reasons behind the process can be forgotten. Organisational values should not be purely aspirational or a marketing stunt; they must be truly authentic to really count. It is crucial that they are reflected throughout the organisation and overlap the behaviours of employees, or trust and integrity can quickly be lost.</span><!--more-->\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">In terms of employer brand and talent attraction, a candidate who begins work in an organisation only to find that the employee value proposition they were sold during the recruitment process was a fallacy will quickly move on to pastures new.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Conversely, if you hire based on authentic values, then those values become ever more deeply ingrained in the fabric of the organisation’s culture. If you want your company to be innovative, you’ll need a team that thinks outside the box. The best way to hire (and retain!) these creative minds is to have an office already filled with people who share the same values.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Organisational values are intrinsically liked with staff engagement. Employee engagement expert <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/david-macleod-employee-engagement/\">David MacLeod OBE</a>, who recently spoke at a <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/highlights-employee-engagement/\">Global Accounting Network Thought Leadership Event</a>, promotes the fact that employers need to create the right environment to enable engagement to flourish in the workforce and find the techniques that speak directly to their employees. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong>This is only possible if a company’s advertised values are truly reflective of its culture. When trust is eroded, the widening gap between values and behaviours can quickly be filled with distrust and demotivation.</strong>\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">When you consider that employee engagement improves productivity and profitability, this is a chance that firms cannot afford to risk. A research paper, <em>Does the stock market full value intangibles? Employee satisfaction and equity prices</em>, conducted by Alex Edmans, Professor of Finance at London Business School, found that over a 25 year period, shareholder returns increased by two to three per cent per year in organisations that were considered great places to work.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Similarly, in <em>Nailing the Evidence</em>, a study by the Employee Engagement Taskforce led by Bruce Rayton at the University Of Bath School Of Management, it is noted that increasing employee engagement can lead to<strong> 2% higher profitability and 8% productivity. </strong></span>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; color: #800000;\">When corporate values fall flat, as Patrick M. Lencioni notes in his Harvard Business Review article on the topic, they ‘create cynical and dispirited employees, alienate customers, and undermine managerial credibility’.

However, with the shifting nature of the workplace, HR professionals are facing an increasing number of complex challenges. Engaging with leading accounting talent has swiftly moved up the strategic agenda - but why should motivating and engaging employees matter more now than ever?</span></h5>\n<!--more-->\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">At a recent interactive seminar hosted by us at the BAFTA headquarters, we discussed the issues at the heart of employee engagement, motivation and retention with David MacLeod OBE, co-Chair of the Employment Engagement launched by the government. It became clear during discussions that organisations are having to work harder to not only recruit but also retain top talent.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Firstly, poor employee engagement can lead to a loss of vital talent, and ultimately damage an organisation’s employer brand. Aside from potential impact on a business’s most valuable resource - <strong>its people</strong> - motivation and positive employee attitudes can increase overall profitability. </span><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">So how can employers ensure that their workforce remains truly motivated? Here's the advice discussed on how to keep your employees successfully engaged:\n</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong>Create a strategy that employees can relate to </strong></span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Organisations that aim to engage their employees need to be aware of the company’s history, its current position, aims and goals, and where it aspires to progress to in the future. Managers cannot create a company’s culture on their own, but they are certainty a driving force in implementing it. The same can be said of strategy, and good leaders need to ensure that they communicate the overall strategy to their teams so that they truly feel a part of their organisations. Employees that can relate to an overarching strategy and understand how their work contributes to the business’s objectives are more likely to feel engaged and stay with the company.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong>Ensure employees have a voice</strong></span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Employees’ ability to voice their ideas and concerns is present throughout all organisations that have high levels of employee engagement. Your team need to feel as though they are being listened to, both when they have ideas and concerns, otherwise employees risk creating a division between employees and leaders.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong>Continuously foster relationships</strong></span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Good leaders can be hard to find. In fact a study from a psychologist, Michelle McQuaid, found that only 35% of US employees would prefer a pay rise to a new boss. The study also found three common characteristics shared by ‘good leaders’. The ability to openly discuss objectives for success and help create individual objectives for different staff members was highlighted as a key skill amongst good leaders. Successful leaders will also recognise that their team is made up of individuals and not ‘human capital’ - they understand that each employees has their own personality and set of aspirations. They also set high standards, and ensure that the support required to reach them is provided on both a formal and informal basis.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong>Develop trust through shared values </strong></span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Most organisations have a set of five of six values, however leaders need to ensure that these are reflected throughout the organisation. Relationships that are built on a set of shared values are likely to be stronger and more productive. Leaders need to ensure that all employees understand the importance of each individual value and why it underpins the work they do. Employees are more likely to feel engaged with leadership if they hold a set of shared values, and are less likely to leave the company.</span>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; color: #800000;\">It’s clear that in a rapidly evolving work environment leaders need to ensure that their employees remain engaged and motived, else they risk higher levels of attrition, lower levels of engagement and ultimately reduced profitability.</span></h5>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/keep-your-employees-engaged.png")},

Business activity hit a 17-month high in December 2016, meaning that the economy grew by 2.2 per cent last year — that’s more than the six other leading nations, including the US, Germany and Japan.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">However, as Adam Chester, head of economics at is Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, <a href=\"https://www.financialdirector.co.uk/2016/12/23/economics-2017-inflation-to-kick-in-and-concerns-over-spending/\">points out</a>, the Brexit negotiations, the implications of Donald Trump’s presidency and upcoming European elections still leave plenty of scope for volatility.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Business-wide growth strategies always rely a certain amount on ability to forecast. This perhaps explains why, according to a recent<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0c3fce4-d0e2-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0\"> survey</a> of economists by the Financial Times, the majority believe that FDs will hold back on investment decisions in the coming months because of uncertainty about Brexit. Despite this, however, both the Confederation of British Industry and the National Institute for Economic and Social Research <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/11/02/economy-to-grow-faster-than-expected-into-2017-as-uk-sustains-po/\">expect</a> GDP to creep up by 1.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively this year, higher than the current Bank of England estimate. Similarly, PwC has <a href=\"http://www.pwc.co.uk/services/economics-policy/insights/uk-economic-outlook.html\">forecast</a> that UK growth will slow to around 1.2 per cent in 2017 due to the drag on business investment from increased political and economic uncertainty.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Of course, the impact of the new global political landscape on individual businesses will vary widely between sectors, but all internal accounting teams have a responsibility to ensure not only that funds are solid regardless of wider economic uncertainty, but also to capitalise on the opportunities that external shifts may bring.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">While it is difficult to predict much of what 2017 holds for accounts departments, we can be sure that professionals will continue to use increasingly sophisticated technologies to enhance traditional ways of working in response to a need for greater efficiency and the demands of managing compliance regulations. In uncertain times, the ability for senior accountants to communicate more widely throughout the company also becomes more important as they are forced to adopt an increasingly advisory role across the business.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">As Abraham Lincoln once said, the best way to predict the future is to create it. There is much we cannot control, but skilled accounting professionals can capitalise on their skills and experience to steer their companies through uncertain waters.</span>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/Future_Forecasting.jpg")},
  {title: "The importance of soft skills in accountancy", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1362\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GAN-Soft-Skills.jpg\" alt=\"GAN Soft Skills\" />\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; color: #801800;\">At a time when accountancy is a career often cited to be most at risk from Robotic Process Automation (RPA), finance professionals can capitalise on innately human attributes such as creativity and emotional intelligence to safeguard their careers.</span></h5>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">It was no surprise that the theme of the World Economic Forum’s 2016 Annual Meeting in Davos was the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Not since the 19<sup>th</sup> century have we witnessed such rapid technological change. However, rather than mechanisation, the contemporary wave of innovation is being driven by artificial intelligence (AI), mass-automation and hyper-connectivity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><!--more--></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Against this backdrop, it is unsurprising that there are widespread fears around how these changes will impact job availability, particularly in traditionally process-led professions such as accountancy.  Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, added fuel to the fire when he warned of a hollowing out of many middle-class services jobs through machine learning and global sourcing. This, he said, could put 15 million Britons out of work as computers take on sophisticated tasks in fields including law and accounting; “Alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods . . . well before the new ones emerge.\".</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">A recent report from Citi and the University of Oxford’s Oxford Martin School, <em>Technology at work: V2.0</em>, concludes that 35 per cent of jobs in the UK are at risk of being replaced by automation, as well as 47 per cent of US jobs. Across the OECD as a whole, an average of 57 per cent of jobs could disappear. The report predicts that many workers will have to retrain in their lifetime as jobs are replaced by machines. Citi subsequently recommended investment in education as the single biggest factor that could help mitigate the impact of increased automation and AI.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Looking at accountancy specifically, the FT recently reported that increasing automation and artificial intelligence are behind the reducing need for armies of graduates who can do the low-level paperwork usually required of them. In short, technology is replacing their jobs. Furthermore, a top executive at Big Four accountancy firm, EY, recently went on record to say that graduate recruitment at auditors and accountants could fall by as much as 50 per cent by 2020 due to the impact of artificial intelligence. Does this spell the end of accountancy as a discipline?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">According to Accenture analysis, transactional tasks are already moving to integrated business services solutions that use robotics, which will automate or eliminate up to 40 per cent of transaction accounting work by 2020. This shift means that finance staff will spend more than 75 per cent of their time, up from 25 per cent today, on decision support, predictive analytics, and performance management. It is here where the value of soft skills comes into play.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">The role of the accountant isn’t disappearing, merely metamorphosing. Today’s professionals must capitalise on the increase in data available to adopt a more advisory role, proactively offering value-added services based on live information</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Despite some controversy surrounding the rise of RPA and AI, a recent poll of Chartered Institute of Accounting Professionals (CIMA) members found that the vast majority were embracing this change, with a whopping 83 per cent of support automation. When asked about the effect of such innovation on businesses, management accountants were most likely to state that the outcome would be more efficient companies as a result of better automation and data analysis (62 per cent), followed by a general up-skilling of the workforce due to the need for more advanced computer skills (47 per cent).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Similarly, ACCA research shows that the next generation of accountants are aware and ready. According to its <em>Generation Next</em> survey of 18,000 finance professionals under the age of 36, more than half (57 per cent) believe that technology will replace entry level roles in the profession, and the majority (84 per cent) welcome this, saying that technology will enable them to focus on higher value-added activity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">This sentiment perhaps explains why a separate survey of CIMA members, undertaken in conjunction with Global Accounting Network, found that professionals are increasingly focusing their CPD efforts on strategic and ‘soft’ skills rather than furthering their technical ability, with the most frequently mentioned areas for improvement including; strategy (36 per cent), influence (29 per cent), and coaching and mentoring (26 per cent).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">As accountancy moves from a purely technical role to a more consultative role, professionals can free up time to analyse data, spot trends and add real value to their organisation. It’s no secret that some elements of traditional accounting are monotonous, tedious and time intensive – it seems that the days of the number cruncher are strictly limited.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">We cannot fight change – we must embrace it. It is worth noting that, according to Deloitte, while technology contributed to the loss of about 800,000 lower-skilled jobs between 2001 and 2015, it helped to create 3.5 million higher-skilled roles in their place. Each of these paid £10,000 more per year than the jobs lost, adding £140 billion to the economy through increased wages.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">As Andrew Harding, CEO of CIMA, points out, “New technologies will make lives easier. They create a short-term shock but deliver long-term benefit. The challenge for businesses is to use change to their advantage.”</span>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Soft-Skills.jpg")},

In fact, according to the 2013 paper, <em>The Future of Employment: How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation (C. Frey &amp; M. Osborne)</em>, there is a 94 per cent chance that AI will lead to job losses in accountancy over the next two decades, making it the second most at-risk role after telemarketing.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><!--more--></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">However, while some commentators have eluded to the fact that a significant shift is close on the horizon, the truth is that we are already in the mist of change - and professionals are adapting in response. Gone are the days when accountants were buried in a stack of box-files with just a printing calculator for company. Financial processes are already largely automated. Precision in repetitive tasks is vital and cloud-based accounting software systems crunch numbers and sift data in real time. This perhaps explains why, according to our latest Salary Survey, which is produced in conjunction with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), almost half (41 per cent) of students said developing core technical knowledge was their priority to aid career progression.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Accountants’ responsibilities traditionally involved following long-established methodologies for information analysis and professional standards for report preparation. Automation is simply alleviating many cumbersome processes, such as bookkeeping and transaction coding, enabling accountants to focus on advisory services and other higher-value work. The rise in AI has also had an overwhelmingly positive impact on accuracy and efficiency. At KPMG, for example, consultants use IBM’s ‘Watson’ to analyse massive volumes of financial data in order to detect anomalies, rather than the historic subset of total data which was necessity given the sheer volume and time constraints.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">However, despite the opportunities that AI offers, the truth is that, for now, it would be near-on impossible to create a piece of software with the ability to exercise the same level of judgement that an experienced qualified accountant has at their disposal. Clashes in legislation mean that emotional intelligence is vital for practitioners to think three-dimensionally when making decisions.

  {title: "Focus on engagement", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1369 size-full\" title=\"Engagement\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-2.jpg\" alt=\"Engagement\" width=\"1301\" height=\"434\" />\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">There is no disputing the impact that employee engagement has on an organisation’s efficiency, productivity and ultimate success. When we recently <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/employee-engagement-impact/\">blogged</a> on the topic, we outlined how studies by the Queens School of Business and Gallup found that disengaged workers had 37% higher absenteeism, 49% more accidents in the workplace, and made 60% more errors and defects.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">However, despite the documented risks associated with poor engagement levels, our own research has found that a company’s ability to connect and communicate with its employees varies considerably between industry sectors. And overall engagement levels still leave much to be desired.</span>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">A survey of 8,000 members and student members of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) found that one in five working in the travel, leisure and tourism sectors rated their current company’s engagement efforts as poor or very poor. The highest levels of satisfaction were to be found amongst those working within consultancy and professional services, with only 11% rating engagement levels as poor and 50% believing their employer’s ability to engage is good or very good. Under half (43%) of all respondents rated their own company’s engagement levels as good or very good. At a time when skills shortages mean great candidates are in high demand, this is clearly cause for concern.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Despite the somewhat poor results, our data is unfortunately not surprising or unexpected. Last year the Chartered Institute for Personnel Development (CIPD) <a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/employee-outlook-spring-2016_tcm18-10903.pdf\">reported</a> that only 44% of employees strongly agree or agree that their organisation provides them with opportunities to learn and grow. Similarly, According to the Gallup organisation’s surveys, employee engagement has barely budged in well over a decade, with research <a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/3154777/data-center/spinning-wheels-on-employee-engagement.html\">revealing</a> just 32% of workers are engaged.     </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">The reasons behind this stagnation aren’t clear, but the perceived requisite investment in time and money mean that some businesses are reluctant to commit to a strategic engagement strategy. This may also explain why consultancy and professionals services firms are faring better than most when it comes to effective engagement – they arguably have greater resources to measure sentiment and implement change. However, engagement needn’t be complex.    </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Ultimately, employee engagement begins and ends with company culture and great leadership. A case in point is HomeServe Membership CEO, Martin Bennett, being identified as the highest-rated CEO in the UK, after receiving a 95% approval rating on careers website Glassdoor. The success of his engagement strategy doesn’t rest on fancy software or detailed algorithms. He sits in the company contact centre and goes on customer calls with his engineers every month. Whatever your HR budget, a back-to-basics engagement strategy enables leaders to gauge sentiment on the ground, and respond accordingly. The bottom line is that companies which fail to engage with their talent effectively risk losing vital skills to the competition. And for experienced management accountants in particular, moving on to a new role in an organisation with a great culture can be as obtainable as it is tempting.       </span>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-2.jpg")},

In fact, research we produced in partnership with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) found that more than half (55%) of qualified accountants are motivated by flexibility and a greater work-life balance when considering a new job role, up from 37% the year prior.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">The <a href=\"http://salary.cimaglobal.com/\">CIMA 2016 salary insights</a> report also found that the number of respondents motivated by flexible working practices now outnumbers those driven by remuneration, this significant shift is illustrative of the changing nature of accountancy roles - it is certainly no longer an archetypal nine to five career.</span>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">The ‘always on’ culture, created by significant technological advancements in recent years, means that achieving a healthy work life balance is becoming increasingly important for professionals. However the same technological advancements have also enabled professionals to work remotely by increasing the ease at which they can communicate with colleagues and clients.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">While the definition of ‘flexible working’ can differ significantly from organisation to organisation, and while it typically includes enabling employees to work outside of traditional office hours, it can also involve working remotely - either from home or a ‘third’ space - or taking a longer break in the middle of the day and then logging on again later in the evening. Differences between definitions of flexible working are to a certain degree related to the nature of different sectors. For example creative industries, such as media and advertising, are far more likely to offer remote working, because the technology required to do so is already heavily imbedded in their working practices. However that’s not to suggest that other sectors won’t follow their lead.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">It’s fair to say there are no real clear cut standards but there is perhaps more scope to work flexibly if you are in an in-house role rather than working in public practice. If you're in an accountancy firm you're working to somebody else's deadline, whereas in an in-house position, you are more likely to be engaged with setting your own deadlines. This, of course, makes flexible working and work life integration easier to manage.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\">Though many employers have been quick to adopt staggered starts and offer flexibility around working hours, few are embracing flexible working in its entirety. However as good talent becomes increasingly short in supply, organisations are becoming ever more aware of the need to be competitive in order to secure the best skills. Although candidates don't yet expect flexible working as a given, it’s likely that as a greater number of millennials enter the workforce it may begin to become a deciding factor between employers and slow adopters - particularly when it comes to the opportunity to work remotely - will ultimately risk missing out on the best people.</span>\n\n&nbsp;", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-3.jpg")},

  {title: "The importance of interpersonal skills in accountancy", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1387 size-full\" title=\"Interpersonal Skills\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-5.jpg\" alt=\"Interpersonal Skills\" width=\"1301\" height=\"434\" />\n\nDeveloping strong interpersonal skills has long been a priority for accountants working in-house. However with research on the evolving role of senior finance professionals from professional services firm, EY, finding that the role of CFO is broadening far beyond its technical foundation into a role that is ever more strategic, the importance of possessing communication and leaderships skills is arguably greater than ever.\n\n<!--more-->\n<h3>The growing need for interpersonal skills</h3>\nThere has been a great deal of commentary regarding the responsibility of the finance function in recent years, much of which has focused on the increasingly strategic role of the CFO, and somewhat unsurprisingly, EY’s ‘<a href=\"http://www.ey.com/gl/en/issues/managing-finance/the-dna-of-the-cfo--an-ernst---young-study-of-what-makes-a-chief-financial-officer\">The DNA of the CFO</a>’ report confirms a continuation of this trend. According to the research 75% of respondents say that they spend 50% or more of their time on strategic aspects of the role, a number which increases to 83% when asked how they expect to spend their time in the future.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that communication and leadership skills are important assets, EY’s report found that as professionals begin to reach the top of the finance function the ability to build effective relationships and demonstrate leadership capabilities become crucial for progression. In fact, when asked what would be needed to reach the next step in their career, over a third of respondents pointed to the need to build stronger internal and external stakeholder relationships as being among the key attributes.\n<h3>A unique perspective</h3>\nAccording to Andy Halford, CFO of Vodafone, “the people who are best positioned to help form the strategy of the business are the people who are in the finance area, because it’s one of those functions that is uniquely interfacing with almost every other aspect of the business.” Ultimately this unique position relies on an ability to communicate effectively with professionals outside of their own function, so it is crucial that individuals work on developing the requisite interpersonal skills to ensure they are able to build and maintain these relationships.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of being able to manage a number of ‘roles’. While the CFO role is certainly now more embedded in the development and enablement of corporate strategy the financial crisis has forced CFOs to increase their focus on the fundamentals of finance as well. Senior finance professionals need to ensure they are able to effectively manage the two aspects of their role, drawing upon both their technical knowledge and leadership qualities when required.\n\nAs the role of the finance function evolves and senior finance positions become increasingly strategic, professionals need to ensure that they focus on developing their interpersonal skills alongside their technical knowledge. In increasingly uncertain times when budgets are under growing scrutiny there is little doubt that finance professionals will be increasingly called upon to inform the overall business strategy. Those with industry leading knowledge and outstanding personal skills will likely find themselves in high demand.", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-5.jpg")},

  {title: "How do you create emotional buy in among your team and maintain an effective dialogue?", description: "<h5><strong>Employee Engagement, Motivation and Retention: The second blog instalment of our Thought Leadership Series</strong></h5>\n<!--more-->\n<h5><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">How do you create emotional buy in among your team and maintain an effective dialogue?</span></strong></h5>\nEveryone is different; something that drive one person to give their all may not be as meaningful or inspirational to another. So how do you motivate a team of diverse talent to each give their absolute discretionary effort? The key is to break down both team motivators and individual motivators by means of effective dialogue, and to ensure that there is true emotional buy in among your organisation.\n\nDialogue is the life-blood of every organisation; however it’s often the case that meaningful conversations are not a genuine focus or priority within an organisation. Without this, how can you have a team who are bought into the fantastic work that your organisation does, and by extension, you as a leader? A happy, engaged employee is an advocate for your company. An unhappy one can go as far as to be a detractor, which is especially relevant in the digital age that we’re experiencing where everything that is said online is there for all to see.\n<h4><strong>The Emotional Buy In</strong></h4>\nWithout a genuine emotional buy in from your team, you will not be able to have a forum for honest and effective dialogue. How do you tune the culture and values to excite your team who are responsible for driving success? One of the methods discussed by our speakers was to include them in the decision of what your core company values are and to help define your culture.\n\nThis method can be used as a great team-building event. During an off-desk meeting you could ask every team member, from receptionist up to CEO, to write down what they believe your core company values are. When you all share them with each other, these values and behaviours really should all be very similar if your brand message is strong - unless your organisation is entirely disengaged or this hasn’t yet been determined. The important part is to accept that there are no wrong answers; the exercise is to collectively determine which you agree on most. You can then determine which five or six values best represent your entire organisation. This should cover your team, your culture and your organisation’s purpose.\n<h5>Display these values for everyone to see and incorporate them into every team meeting or event. If your team members know and feel they were a true part in determining what you all stand for, they will also feel they were instrumental in a core part of defining the company culture.</h5>\n<h4><strong>The Effective Dialogue</strong></h4>\nIf you’re in a leadership position with a fully engaged and motivated team, chances are you’ve had to earn the right to be heard. It’s not as easy for people to truly believe your motivational talks, your announcements and your instructions unless they feel they are genuinely valued and included in the company rather than just another ordinary employee. Below are just a few of the easy ways which we discussed to engage with your team on personal basis to be implemented, and will be highly effective if routine and sincere.\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>One-to-one meetings</strong> – both formal and informal: find out what drives them, what their aspirations are both generally and within the company, and what they need from you to reach their potential. This could be scheduled in over a monthly or weekly catch up, as well as over a pint every now and then. You can then work together on how this can be built into their progression plan and show that you want to develop people.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Group forums</strong>: get everyone together to explain why certain objectives are in place and find out how effective people feel they are. Encourage open and honest discussion about how your team operates, what they feel their strengths are as well as how they feel things can improve, and be completely open to what they suggest.</li>\n</ul>\nAsk questions and listen to the answers in full. They are the front line of your company; ensuring that they are happy and feeling fulfilled means they will naturally exude enthusiasm and empowerment when dealing with your clients, customers, and each other.\n<h5><em>We discussed the other ways you can create emotional buy in and maintain an effective dialogue – <strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">our white paper will discuss this in full</span></strong> so keep an eye out on our <a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GAN_Recruit\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Twitter</span></a>, <a title=\"LinkedIn\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-accounting-network\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">LinkedIn</span></a> and <a title=\"Blog\" href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Blog</span></a> Page for its release!</em></h5>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: nil},

Get in touch with them by clicking these links and they'll help you with your planning and finding a job!\n</em>\n\n<!--more-->\n<h4 class=\"entry-title\"></h4>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #800000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">So - you’ve got a few years’ experience under your belt working in the accounting sector but you’re struggling to contain your travel bug. Lucky for you, accounting is a skill that you can use when on your travels and could be the ideal solution to your wanderlust when backpacking through Sydney. To help you make an informed decision about whether this is the right move for you, we have put together a guide to living and working as a backpacker in this great city’s accounting sector.</span></h5>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Why Sydney?</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">To most, the answer to this is reasonably obvious, but in case it’s not; Sydney is the biggest and most diverse city in Australia, has ‘mostly’ good weather year-round (although be prepared for the extremes) and is Australia’s backpacker hub. Because of this, Sydney is the ideal place from which to explore the rest of the country.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Accounting Job Opportunities</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">As Australia’s biggest business centre, a large percentage of all international firms choose Sydney as their regional hub, leading to excellent corporate opportunities. In addition, Sydney has a large public sector presence and a brilliant start-up environment. With so many different options, finding the right company for you is easier here than anywhere else in Australia.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Because backpacking is such a common occurrence in Sydney, most employers are used to having short-term accounting professionals in their teams. Backpackers are often brought in to meet seasonal demands or simply to fill workforce gaps. The length of contract can vary, from days to months, but always within the constraints of your visa. It’s important to note that every employer will expect you to complete the full length of the assignment. So it can be a good idea to complete one assignment, explore Australia for a few weeks then come back and top up your travel funds again with another assignment.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">In-demand skill sets are generally any degree qualified accountants with two to eight years’ commercial experience. CA, CPA, ACCA or CIMA qualifications are helpful, but not essential to work in Australia. Typical backpacker jobs include: Financial and Management Accountant, Payroll Officer, AR/Collections Officer, Accounts Payable Officer, Bookkeeper, and Assistant Accountant.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Work Visas</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Most backpackers are eligible for the Australian “Working Holiday Maker Program”, which is generally open to people aged 18-30 who are citizens of an eligible partner country. The application process when compared to other visas is relatively simple. For further information, please click <strong><a href=\"https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/417-\">here</a></strong>. If you aren’t eligible for a working holiday visa there are other options available, which can be found on the Australian Immigration <strong><a href=\"https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Work\">website</a></strong>.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Work Culture</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Working in Sydney is not unlike most other major cities around the world; professionalism, punctuality, presentation etc. are still just as important for the transient worker. Even though all of your personal belongings may fit in a ‘rucksack’ and may not include business attire, the Sydney accounting sector is professional. Finding a business suit for your interviews and subsequent jobs should be one of your first priorities when thinking about finding work; first impressions do count. Business hours are generally 8.30am/9am to 5/5.30pm, however can be longer due to accounting deadlines. Despite the famous (stereotype of a) laid back Australian work culture, hard work is still an expectation.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Pay &amp; Taxes</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Pay rates range depending on your experience and particular skill-set, but suffice to say it’s more than enough to have a good quality of life and fund your travel to see the rest of Australia. All Richard Lloyd temps are paid weekly based on hours worked. In Australia, a standard working week is around 38 hours, but you will need to apply for a Tax File Number. Australia has new Backpacker tax laws which mean you’ll only pay $0.19 for every $1.00 you earn – for more details on the most recent developments click <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37482670\">here</a></strong>. Irrespective of your visa, assuming you meet certain criteria, you will also be eligible for superannuation. If you’d like to find out specific pay rates for your skill-set please get in touch with one of our specialist accounting recruiters.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"> Accommodation, Transport, Banking &amp; Healthcare</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">As a backpacking hub, there are a broad range of accommodation options available in Sydney; from long term backpacker hostels through to shared rentals with similar minded business professionals.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Travel is relatively simple. Sydney has a great rail network, regular buses and ferries (yes, you can commute by ferry) and a large tram network is currently being built. To use the public transport network, you will need to have an ‘<strong><a href=\"https://www.opal.com.au/\">Opal</a></strong>’ card, similar to other transport systems around the world where cash is no longer an option.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">As you’d expect, there are a large number of banks, some of which also have offices overseas. Applying for an account is fairly straightforward providing you have identification and a verifiable Sydney address.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Medicare is the national health system and the benefits vary depending on your country of residence. It is important to register with Medicare when you first arrive if eligible. Go to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/enablers/health-care-visitors-australia\">Medicare</a></strong> website to find out more details.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">Getting Started</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">If you’re keen to find out more about the accounting opportunities that exist for backpackers, then you’re in the right place. Our recruiters regularly help like-minded working travellers through the process of finding work, from the early planning stages to your first day at your new Sydney job. <strong><a href=\"http://www.richardlloyd.com.au/contact\">Click here</a></strong> to contact one of our team, before you travel or when you arrive; it doesn’t matter when!</span>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/pablo-5.png")},
  {title: "Why Employee Engagement Matters: the measurable impact", description: "<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-accounting-network\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1321\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/engagemnet.png\" alt=\"Employee Engagement - Measurable Impact\" /></a>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; color: #800000;\">According to research-based consultancy Gallup, just 13% of employees worldwide are fully engaged in their roles. Thankfully, our research shows that the UK &amp; Ireland accountancy sector is faring much better – but there is still room for improvement.</span></h5>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><!--more--></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">If we look at the research results that we obtained from partnering with CIMA on the Salary Survey of 2016, 41% of CIMA members rate their current company’s ability to engage with their employees as ‘average’, with almost one in five (17%) rating their employer’s efforts as ‘poor’. So what’s the actual measurable impact of this?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">According to studies by the Queens School of Business and Gallup, disengaged workers had 37% higher absenteeism, 49% more accidents in the workplace, and made 60% more errors and defects. Furthermore, organisations with low employee engagement scores experienced 18% lower productivity, 16% lower profitability and 65% lower share price over time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #800000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong>Clearly, investing in engagement pays dividends – but how can leaders improve relationships with their people?</strong></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">The answer lies in communication. Leaders that engage with their team most effectively recognise their employees as individuals, identify them for who they are, build their confidence and find what is important to them not only professionally, but also personally. Conversation is the lifeblood of every organisation, and while it’s a given that leaders should be good at the ‘big talk’ they should not underestimate the importance of pleasantries and the personal touch, asking questions to find how they can better support their people.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">When asked specifically how their employers could better themselves in terms of engagement, those who rated their company’s efforts as ‘average’ said a major improvement would be to improve work life balance and increase incentives. Even respondents who rated their employer’s efforts as ‘good’ said improving work life balance would boost engagement. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">It is worth noting that a separate analysis from recruitment software provider, Kenexa, recently found that if the UK could move its employee engagement levels to the middle of the top quartile, such as that for the Netherlands, this would be associated with a <span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>£25.8bn increase in GDP.</strong></span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\">While it’s reassuring that almost half of CIMA members surveyed for our report said that their employer is doing a good job of engagement, there is no doubt that those who could do better are missing out on the economic and social benefits associated with an engaged workforce. <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/clients/feedback-form/\">How would you and your team rate your organisation?</a></span>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/engagemnet.png")},
  {title: "Why company culture matters", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1392\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Culture-Matters.jpg\" alt=\"Why does company culture matter?\" />\nFollowing an experiment using comedy and snacks, the University of Warwick's Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy concluded that happiness makes people 12% more productive at work while unhappy workers are 10% less productive. What’s more, companies with happy employees are said to outperform the competition by 20%. However, despite this evidence, research consultancy Gallup has found that just 13% of employees are engaged globally. Company culture matters, and the ability to <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/focus-on-engagement/\">engage employees effectively</a> is a valuable asset for any organisation.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nYou only have to look back a matter of weeks to see the impact that actively disengaged employees can have on an organisation. Highly publicised strike action by Southern Rail employees not only affected thousands of commuters, but will also cause an estimated £15m profit hit for its owner, Go-Ahead, this year.\n\nEmployer and consumer brands are intrinsically linked, and if perception is poor internally, the wider repercussions on the external brand can be catastrophic. Just look at the momentum behind the    #DeleteUber hashtag following the company’s apparent support of Trump’s policies. It couldn’t have helped that the brand was already negatively perceived in the public consciousness with its business model viewed by many as a race to the bottom in terms of wages and workers’ rights. Conversely, much of equity of the John Lewis brand is tied up in its approach to employment – where colleagues are partners in the business rather than mere employees.\n<h5><strong>Company culture must be nurtured </strong></h5>\nGood reputations are hard to gain and easy to lose, which is why company culture must be nurtured with care. A myriad of evidence suggests that today’s workforces are driven by more than just a hefty pay packet. In order to attract the best talent, an organisation must promote its values and HR policies through social media using its own people as its greatest advocates. People work to live, not live to work, which is why incentives such as flexible working and the opportunity to upskill and innovate should not be underestimated. Google’s 20% time programme for example, where employees only have to spend 80% of their working hours on company business, will have done nothing to deter applications.\n\nCrucially though, a culture which has been promoted externally must be reflected in reality when a new starter lands in an organisation. Attracting talent is one thing, but retaining it is quite another. And with Oxford Economics calculating that replacing a single member of staff costs employers an average of £30,614 per employee when factors such as lost productivity are taken into account, low turnover rates are certainly good for business.\n<h5><strong>Company culture cannot be ignored</strong></h5>\nWhile the correlation between staff engagement, productivity and an organisation’s bottom line are well documented, the relationship is arguably most acute within finance teams. Accountants are on the front line of a company’s performance, and those who buy into their company’s values and ethos go the extra mile to make decisions which are in the best interests of the organisation. It’s the accountants who live and breathe your brand who will be the ones spotting trends and identifying new revenue streams – not the disengaged number crunchers who are going through the motions. At a time when employment rates are high and competition for talent is fierce, the importance of company culture cannot be ignored.\n\nFor more insights – check out our <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\">blog homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/Culture-Matters.jpg")},
  {title: "What does gender pay reporting mean for accountants?", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1397\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-6.jpg\" alt=\"GAN Blog Featured Image Template 6\" />\n\nWith International Women’s Day having taken place earlier this week, there is arguably no more pertinent time to discuss the importance of women in leadership and the gender pay gap. Numerous studies prove that companies with females in senior management roles have a clear competitive edge. When senior leaders are too alike, they are more likely to share one common perspective and address challenges in the same way, while by contrast, diverse executive teams are more likely to innovate and be successful. But what does gender pay disclosure mean for the profession?\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<strong>Revealing the imbalance</strong>\n\nWorryingly, figures from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants’ (CIMA) ‘Breaking glass: Strategies for tomorrow’s leaders’ report found that on average, male CIMA members earn 24% more than female CIMA members in the UK. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) the picture is similar across the wider profession, with female chartered accountants earning on average 11% less than their male counterparts.\n\nMandatory gender pay gap reporting, which came into force in October 2016, will require organisations with over 250 employees to review gender pay data for the first time in April 2017 and employers will be required to analyse and publish this data no later than April 2018. In addition to both a median and mean calculation, employers will be required to report on the number of men and women working within salary quartiles.\n\nFor professionals working in practice these annual publications are likely to be particularly revealing, highlighting pay discrepancies between male and female colleagues performing the same role. While for management accountants it is likely to reveal inconsistencies between male and female employees within levels of seniority, for example a female CFO would be able to review her own pay in comparison to her male C-Suite peers.\n\n<strong>A new approach </strong>\n\nWith the gender reporting regulations likely to reveal what many female accountancy professionals already suspect - that they are being paid less than their male colleagues - it’s clear that the profession as a whole needs to take a new approach to promoting inclusivity. The gender pay gap is no doubt, at least in part, caused by a lack of women in senior roles, and in fact, CIMA’s research found that female members are six times less likely than male members to occupy senior roles such as CFO or CEO.\n\nAccording to case studies complied by CIMA, the main challenges faced by female management accountants are achieving a satisfying work-life balance, and the difficulty of being taken seriously in a male dominated business. However employers can help to address these challenges and improve female representation by encouraging mentoring, <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/flexible-working-is-on-the-rise/\">offering flexible working practices</a>, and actively providing female employees with <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/focus-on-engagement/#more-1368\">opportunities for professional development</a>.\n\nWith gender pay reporting set to reveal discrepancies in pay, there is no longer anywhere for employers to hide. Organisations need to ensure that they actively encourage females to apply for leadership positions and make selection criteria and processes transparent if they hope to increase gender diversity and readdress growing remuneration imbalances.\n\nFor more insights – check out our <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\">blog homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-6.jpg")},
  {title: "Accountant jobs overseas: what you need to know", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1402\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-7.jpg\" alt=\"GAN Blog Featured Image Template 7\" />\n\nWhile many professionals dream of expanding their skill-sets with jobs overseas, the prospect of getting qualified in a new territory can often be a barrier to making it happen. However, for qualified accountants looking to experience life in a new country, getting the green light to practice internationally may be easier than you think.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhile anyone moving outside of the EU for work will, of course, be subject to local visa restrictions, holding the relevant qualifications is the first step to being qualified to be offered a ‘specific offer of employment’ -  a prerequisite of many work visas.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t necessarily mean that professionals who have relevant experience will have to go back to the drawing board in terms of education. In the US, for example, it is possible to become qualified as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with no further training.\n<h2>Jobs overseas: is the US the logical choice?</h2>\nGlobal Accounting Network’s sister company, <a href=\"https://www.hoxtoncircle.com/\">Hoxton Circle</a>, is based in the US, and for clients across the pond a CPA licence can be a prerequisite for any accounting role. The criteria for becoming a licenced CPA varies between states – so it is vital that you do some research to see how your existing qualifications stack up against state board office requirements. However, it is worth noting that most states have passed mobility laws in order to allow practice in their state by CPAs from other states. So once you have the licence, it’s pretty mobile.\n\nWhile each state board sets its own requirements regarding education and experience, broadly speaking, <em>a</em>ll CPA candidates must hold a bachelor’s degree, at minimum, and have no fewer than 150 semester hours of formal education, must achieve a passing score on the Uniform CPA Exam and gain field experience under the supervision of a licensed CPA. In most states and jurisdictions, one year of supervised experience satisfies the requirement.\n\nEligibility to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam is determined by individual state boards of accountancy. A decision is made after existing qualifications are submitted and evaluated by a local university admissions officer to get a comparison to US qualifications.\n\nWhile some professionals will be able to sit the exam with no further training, others may need to complete additional courses before they qualify to sit. However, it is worth noting that these courses can usually be completed in your country or origin before setting foot in the US.\n\nFor those with their sights set on destinations more exotic than the states, it is worth noting that while the CPA qualification is US based, it is internationally recognised. CPA exams can be taken in several other countries, including Japan, Lebanon, Kuwait, Bahrain, Brazil and the UAE, and the qualification is recognised in the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nFor candidates who are ACA qualified, the ICAEW has partnerships with accountancy bodies around the world, so those planning to live and work in another country may be able to join a local institute automatically. Membership recognition agreements are currently in place with organisations including CAANZ in Australia and New Zealand, HKICPA in Hong Kong, SAICA in South Africa.\n\nSimilarly, the creation of the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation in 2011, which is a joint venture between The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), means that CIMA accreditation is now more globally recognised than ever before.\n\nWhile it can take some time to get your head around alternative processes and local legislation, core competencies such as <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/interpersonal-skills/\">interpersonal skills</a> and technical ability travel well. And for those who are eager to climb the career ladder, international experience really can pay dividends.  Feel free to contact either GAN at <a href=\"mailto:info@globalaccountingnetwork.net\">info@globalaccountingnetwork.net</a> or Hoxton Circle at <a href=\"mailto:info@hoxtoncircle.com\">info@hoxtoncircle.com</a>\n\nFor more insights – check out our <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\">blog homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-7.jpg")},

The golden rule is to keep it under three pages. For professionals in the latter stages of their career that can appear to be quite a feat, so how can you find the balance between informative and punchy? Firstly, make sure to place emphasis on directly relevant experience and only briefly mention less significant roles. While it is also important to highlight all of your professional qualifications, there is little need to list individual modules or grades – they aren’t likely to swing things in your favour but will take up valuable space that could be used more efficiently.\n\n<strong>Write your CV for the job you want, not the job you have</strong>\n\nEvery time you apply for a role you should specifically tailor your skills and experience to relate to the position’s specific requirements. Try to view your ‘standard’ CV as framework for you to build upon, rather than a finalised product. Given the need to be concise, the version you submit for one role may not necessarily cover all of the requirements of another, even if they have the same job title. For example one organisation may stress the need for experience in a leadership position, while another may favour creative decision making skills. So it is important to make sure you adapt your resume to include relevant skills and examples to meet each role’s individual specification. It will likely be fairly obvious to a prospective employer, or indeed a recruitment agency, if you send out a generic CV and, generally speaking, suggests you aren’t particularly interested in a role.\n\n<strong>Show Achievements</strong>\n\nBroadly speaking we know what a management accountant does and so will your potential employer, so a list of responsibilities may not be that useful. A good CV is a marketing tool and should highlight what distinguishes you from the pack. A strong set of achievements under each role could therefore really paint the picture of your contribution and your potential. A strong recommendation would be to include some bullet points of responsibilities along with some specific, tangible, measurable achievements.\n\n<strong>Getting the basics right is fundamental</strong>\n\nFormatting is also crucial. Your CV should look both professional, and attractive, so keep the font and text size consistent throughout. Make sure that all of the most important information is at the top of the first page, and improve readability by breaking up long sections of text by using bullet points and tables where possible. The remits of a management accountant’s role means that employers are unlikely to be looking for creatively designed CVs, but ensuring that its layout is engaging is still important.\n\nPerhaps the most important, if slightly obvious, tip is to thoroughly check your CV for any grammatical errors. Basic spelling errors and typos are incredibly easy to make, however they look highly unprofessional and will harm your chances of being considered for a role, so ensure that once you’ve checked it, you get someone else to read it through thoroughly. It’s also important to make sure that your CV uses concise language and avoids long complex sentences which aren’t particularly engaging.\n\nFor more insights and career advice – check out our <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\">blog homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-8.jpg")},
  {title: "What to look for in a future employer", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1408 size-full\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-9.jpg\" alt=\"What to look for in a future employer\" width=\"1301\" height=\"434\" />\nThere is little doubt amongst employers that the nature of work is changing, and candidates are increasingly looking for working practices that suit their individual career goals and cultures that foster their personal growth. However, as a candidate, establishing exactly how well you will fit within a specific organisation can be challenging, so aside from strong remuneration, what should accountants be looking for in a potential employer?\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<strong>Is flexibility key?</strong>\n\nFlexibility is now the number one motivator for qualified accountants when they are looking for their next role. In fact, according to research we produced in partnership with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), work-life balance is the number one consideration for 55% of accountants, up from 37% the year prior. Asking about a potential employer’s existing flexible working policies, and whether they have the technology in place to enable employees to work remotely is important. Even if you don’t necessarily work flexibly in your current role, agile working policies can allow finance professionals to manage their work/life balance more effectively.\n\nIt’s also crucial that professionals look for employers with workplace environments that suit their own working practices and professional strengths. For example, while some candidates may prefer to work in collaborative teams, others might be more productive while working autonomously, so it’s crucial that you consider the kind of environment fostered by potential employers prior to accepting a role with them. It’s also worth contemplating whether your own values align with the organisation’s strategic goals and the ethics of its leaders, if you own principles sit well alongside the organisation’s own values you will likely be a better cultural fit within the business.\n\n<strong>Considering career development opportunities </strong>\n\nThere’s little doubt that professional development is crucial throughout an accountant’s career and it is important to evaluate the training and development initiatives on offer at an organisation prior to applying for a role with them. According to the latest CIMA Salary Insights survey almost two thirds (69%) of accountants are planning on learning new skills within the next year to aid their career progression. Management accountants are often focused on learning new skills such as strategy (36%), influence (29%) and coaching and mentoring (26%). When looking for a new role, considering opportunities for growth is key, and it is worth exploring the training opportunities currently on offer with any organisation.\n\nFor professional looking for a new challenge, it’s also worth looking closely at the role on offer, and potential opportunities for progression within an organisation. Many accountants change roles looking for a new challenge, whether that be to gain more responsibilities, the opportunity to lead a team, or simply a more challenging workload. It’s therefore important to consider exactly what kind of change you are looking for and whether an organisation, or indeed a specific role, can offer you the routes for progression you are looking for.\n\nFor more insights and career advice – check out our <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\">blog homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-9.jpg")},
  {title: "What does the apprenticeship levy mean for the accountancy profession?", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1412\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-10.jpg\" alt=\"GAN Blog Featured Image Template 10\" />Business leaders at organisations with payrolls over £3m per year will no doubt all be preparing for the implementation of the Apprenticeship Levy, which was first announced in the 2015 Summer Budget, and is set to come into effect on 6th April. As most finance professionals will already be aware, the levy requires the UK’s largest employers to invest in apprenticeships. But how can accounting functions make the levy work in their favour, and use it to help address ongoing skills shortages?\n\n<!--more-->\nThe digital funds employers receive in return for their contribution - which equates to 0.5% of their annual pay bill – can be used towards training facilitated by approved providers. The levy also gives organisations access to additional funding offered by the government through co-investment which can also be used towards training additional apprentices or, alternatively, to upskill current workers through more advanced training. However, these funds will expire two years after entering the organisation’s digital account unless they are spent, it’s simple – if organisations fail to make use of these funds to support apprenticeship training they’ll simply lose their contribution.\n\nGrowing skills shortages\n\nSkills shortages in the accounting profession have long been a topic of discussion in the UK, and indeed on a global scale, with global healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson recently reporting that it took the company six months to fill an open position for a junior-level accountant in its financial-compliance department last year. Indeed figures from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) revealed that 39% of organisations believe that a lack of skilled professionals is having a negative impact on their business.\n\nThese existing shortages are also being exacerbated by a reduction in training places available to graduates. In fact, a top executive at Big Four accountancy firm, EY, recently went on record to say that graduate recruitment of auditors and accountants could fall by as much as 50 per cent by 2020.\n\nNot just for junior roles\n\nThough often inherently associated with labour intensive careers, apprenticeships, particularly at degree level, can provide an excellent route into the employment market for highly ambitious talent with the analytical skills to succeed in accountancy. The levy can provide organisations with the opportunity, and the funding, to address growing skills shortages, and improve talent pipelines into the profession.\n\nHowever, skills shortages aren’t only a concern at entry and junior levels, and many global organisations struggling to fill senior finance roles - indeed we once recruited for a Director of Finance role for a leading global pharmaceutical company which had remained vacant for over a year. Employers should remember that money paid into the scheme, and all associated government co-investment, can also be put towards training existing employees to a higher level than the qualifications they already possess. Offering employers the opportunity to reassess their wider learning and development initiatives and upskill finance professionals in areas which may have previously been put off due to the perceived costs of additional training.\n\nFor more insights – check out our blog <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\">homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-10.jpg")},
  {title: "Why accountants need to be embracing automation", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1417\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-11.jpg\" alt=\"GAN Blog Featured Image Template 11\" />\n\nFinance functions are under significant pressure across all industries to reduce costs and support decreasing margins, improve the volumes and quality of information provided, and arguably most importantly, to focus on delivery of value adding insights to the business. So it is somewhat unsurprising, in light of mounting pressures, that many accountants are coming to realise the benefits of embracing automation and adopting AI programmes.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIn fact in a recent report produced by global enterprise software company Sage, a staggering 96% of accountants indicated they feel positively about the role that automation will play in their day-to-day process. In its ‘<em>The Practice of Now’</em> report, for which it surveyed 700 accountants, Sage revealed that systems automation is welcomed and considered a strategic asset to their business.\n\n<strong>The changing role of the accountant </strong>\n\nHowever, with 68% of accountants indicating that they see their role changing in some form through automation and 35% revealing administrative tasks are the most enjoyable part of their role it is reasonable that some professionals are concerned about the long term impact that automation will have on their careers. Indeed, according to Sage, 38% of accountants see emerging technology as the biggest threat to the accountancy profession.\n\nWith the press keen to focus on the negative impacts of automation, these fears are understandable. Most accountants will likely have seen the widely reported story which suggests that 35% of current jobs in the UK are at high risk of ‘computerisation’ over the following 20 years, however in an ever shifting business environment accountants have far more to offer than just the traditional administrative aspects of their role.\n\nAccountants in practice are now seen as a business partner, while their industry counterparts are largely viewed as strategic advisors. In both professional settings accountancy professionals can provide insightful advice and support across the business based on a sound understanding of the company.\n\n<strong>Embracing automation to provide greater strategic value </strong>\n\nThere is little doubt that in the future automation will play a significant role in shaping the responsibilities of accounting professionals. However by relying on their outstanding commercial awareness, strong communication and demonstrating their ability to make well informed financial decisions, accountants can continue to prove their strategic value. Organisations will increasingly look for professionals with expertise in reporting, forecasting and a high degree of competency in risk management, in potential employees.\n\nAccountants who embrace automation, and make use of the opportunities it provides to develop interpersonal and leadership skills will no doubt see their careers thrive, and organisations which incorporate AI programmes into their working practices will ultimately see costs diminish and their finance function able to focus on providing more valuable strategic insight.\n\nFor more insights and career advice – check out our blog <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/news/\">homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/GAN-Blog-Featured-Image-Template-11.jpg")},
  {title: "How to prepare for interviews more effectively", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1420\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/how-to-prepare-for-interviews-more-effectively.png\" alt=\"how-to-prepare-for-interviews-more-effectively\" />\n\nWhile few organisations have recruitment processes as complex and challenging as the likes of household names from Silicon Valley, it’s fair to say that businesses are increasingly putting management accountants through their professional paces during interviews. In an increasingly competitive talent market, organisations are looking to find the best suited candidate who can demonstrate the full extent of their knowledge and experience. So how can you prepare for interviews more effectively?\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2><strong>Tailor your application\n\n</strong></h2>\nBefore even beginning the application process you need to ensure that you read the job specification thoroughly to establish the kind of candidate a company is looking for, and the responsibilities the role is likely to entail. It’s also crucial that you research the organisation, and spend time a significant amount of time considering how you can amend your CV to demonstrate the required abilities and your relevant experience.\n<h2><strong>Prepare for interviews with engaging answers\n\n</strong></h2>\nIrrespective of the seniority of the role you are applying for you should be prepared to answer some relatively standard interview questions. Instead of forgoing preparation for this, prepare some insightful and engaging responses which demonstrate specific areas of knowledge or experience. And rather than just citing a list of skills when asked ‘what are your strengths?’ mention one specific area of expertise which is directly relevant to the role you are applying for and, wherever possible, use an example to demonstrate this strength.\n\nThe same principle applies when asked ‘what are your weaknesses?’ Instead of listing one or two weakness prepare a response which shows you are continually assessing yourself, and are taking proactive steps to improve upon any flaws. Consider picking a skill or area of experience relevant to a slightly more senior role to show you understand the skills required to progress and are eager to upskill yourself.\n\nSome companies have a very structured competency based process. A good response to a competency question includes an answer, an example and a tangible result. Think about where you have delivered the things on the job spec, what your part in those tasks was, how you planned and executed and most importantly what the outcome was. This will really emphasise your results focus and your contributions.\n<h2><strong>Demonstrate your skills and successes\n\n</strong></h2>\nSenior finance professionals will want you to demonstrate your experience and relate it to the role on offer, so it’s crucial that you are able to substantiate responses with evidence of how you have applied your knowledge and skills in your current role. For every example make sure you can explain the reasoning behind your course of action, how you delivered the task, and the short and long term outcomes.\n\nGiven the <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/interpersonal-skills/\">evolving nature of the finance function</a>, it’s highly likely that you will be asked about your leadership qualities and it is important that you are able to demonstrate your ability to effectively lead others. As the role of the senior finance professional becoming increasingly strategic, professionals need to ensure that they focus on developing their interpersonal skills alongside their technical knowledge, so make sure to show how you have utilised your communication and leadership skills in your current role.\n<h2><strong>Ask insightful questions\n\n</strong></h2>\nLast, but by no means least, it is important that you have at least two or three insightful and considered questions prepared for your interviewer. As we all know, interviews are just as much of an opportunity for candidates to get to know a business, so asking an interviewer about the long term goals of the firm, or about the organisation’s culture can provide you with a better understanding of the company you are looking to join. Questions that start with “Through my research I noticed that…” or “On your website I read that…” show you have prepared and make the questions really relevant to the business.\n\nFor more insights – check out our <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\">blog homepage.</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/how-to-prepare-for-interviews-more-effectively.png")},

But are accountants confident in the future prospects of their businesses?\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2><strong>\nEconomic indicators </strong></h2>\nThe British Chambers of Commerce recently <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/companies-feel-confident-after-year-starts-well-c7vk2zp8l\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that Britain’s companies had a solid start to the year with conditions expected to continue improving throughout 2017, suggesting that the resilience of the economy since the vote to leave the European Union is holding up. According to a survey of its members, domestic and export sales increased compared with the end of 2016, hiring intentions were up and confidence in turnover and profitability was improving.\n\nThe results echoed recent economic indicators that suggested the economy <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/uk-economic-growth-slowed-to-04-in-first-quarter-pmi-data-10825954\" target=\"_blank\">expanded</a> by at least 0.4 per cent in the first quarter. The Federation of Small Businesses has also <a href=\"http://startups.co.uk/small-business-confidence-at-highest-level-in-a-year/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that sentiment among members is at a 15-month high.\n<h2><strong>\nAre accountants confident?  </strong></h2>\nAccording to the latest <a href=\"http://www.icaew.com/-/media/corporate/files/technical/economy/economic-insight/uk-economic-forecast/q1-2017.ashx?la=en\" target=\"_blank\">ICAEW UK Business Confidence Monitor</a> (BCM) - which is based on official data and a survey of 1,000 UK businesses to determine confidence, financial performance, challenges and expectations for the year ahead – the UK continues to enjoy a good degree of ‘economic momentum’.\n\nRespondents are chartered accountants working in businesses of all types, across every economic sector and in all regions of the UK. The findings indicate slower, though still respectable, growth in 2017, close to the average from 2010-2013. While business investment looks to be largely on hold this year, until the impact of Brexit negotiations on the UK economy become clear.\n\nWhile a 1.9% fall in business investment in 2017 isn’t ideal, compared to the 16% drop recorded during the global financial crisis in 2009, this is largely seen as a ‘pause on spending rather than a collapse’.\n\nIt seems that management accountants are, unsurprisingly, taking a risk-adverse approach to future planning. However, a quiet confidence in the market remains evident. According to the ICAEW’s report, firms believe they will maintain their profit margins in 2017, despite rising input costs. And with the Bank of England likely to keep borrowing costs low, investment has every chance of rebounding once we have more clarity on the UK’s future relationship with Europe.\n\nYou can read more insights on the Global Accounting Network <a href=\"http://www.globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog\" target=\"_blank\">blog homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/Economy-GAN.jpg")},

But what do these 11<sup>th</sup> hour cuts mean for accountants in the short term?\n\n<!--more-->\nThe announcement of a snap General Election has put the buffers on planned changes around dividend incomes, an overhaul of the non-dom rules and plans to force all businesses to keep digital tax records. Changes to corporate loss relief and interest deductibility – designed to counter the use of aggressive avoidance methods – have also been postponed. For many in-house accountants, who have begun to plan and act based on draft legislation, this has understandably created some confusion – with measures already being implemented before they become law.\n\n<strong>Uncertain times</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>The Chartered Institute of Taxation recently went on record to welcome the announcement, but stressed the fact that there is still uncertainty around whether all the measures would be introduced on the date originally planned. Bill Dodwell, president, has called on the government, “to make a clear statement about whether — if re-elected — all of the clauses dropped will be reintroduced on the original timetable.”\n\nIndeed, for a discipline which is founded on solid information and thrives on predictable patterns, this state of limbo is mildly disconcerting.\n\n<strong>Making Tax Digital: the most significant of cuts to the Finance Bill?</strong>\n\nLooking at <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/autumn-statement-what-it-means-for-management-accountants/\" target=\"_blank\">Making Tax Digital</a> in particular, it is no secret that these controversial changes – designed to force companies away from annual returns – have caused much dispute around the viability and timescale of the proposals. This contention culminated with the ICAEW, the Federation of Small Businesses and ACCA joining forces to call for all clauses relating to MTD in the Finance Bill to be removed.\n\nSince the Finance Bill was slashed, Junior Minister Jane Ellison, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, told Parliament there has been no policy change and that Making Tax Digital is among the measures the Conservative Party plans to pursue in the next Parliament – although it’s anyone’s best guess what’s been going on behind the scenes.\n\nFor Government, shelving proposed changes provides a little extra breathing space to scrutinise and fine-tune complex, even revolutionary, proposals. For accountants, this delay offers the gift of a little extra time to ensure that their house is in order should these changes come into fruition.\n\nAnd with just six weeks to go until Election Day, this unwelcome uncertainty should soon come to an end, enabling professionals in this area to make well-informed decisions, leading to future stability, growth and profitability of their organisations.\n\nFor more insights, check out our <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">blog homepage</a>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/Finance-Bill-Blog.jpg")},

Furthermore, <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/are-accountants-confident-in-the-economy/#more-1438\" target=\"_blank\">economic confidence</a> amongst respondents has also enjoyed a boost, with over half of the UK companies featured expecting the domestic economy to improve over the next 12 months, a figure which has risen dramatically from 4% last year.\n<h2><strong>M&amp;A boom: impact on skills </strong></h2>\nAgainst this backdrop, it is no surprise that we are experiencing an increase in demand for accounting professionals with a strong background in due diligence. And as an increasing number of companies look to inorganic growth strategies to remain relevant amidst almost constant geopolitical uncertainty and rapid technological change, this trend only looks set to continue.\n\nAs Steve Ivermee, EY’s transaction advisory services managing partner, points out, \"UK companies are adjusting their strategies to maximise growth opportunities and protect margins amid changing market dynamics at home and abroad”. It is no wonder then that firms are looking to experienced accounting professionals to help them pin down and assess the viability of the options available.\n<h2><strong>Good news for accounting specialists</strong></h2>\nEY's report also reveals the largest perceived economic risks for UK companies in the next six-to-twelve months include; currency instability (15%), movement of labour (13%) and trade flows (13%). For this reason, the most sought after professionals can not only process financial risks, historic data, and undisclosed liabilities, but also possess 360 degree understanding of external threats – and future opportunities.\n\nThere is particular demand for accountants with a solid grip on technology, who can harness data to provide insights into future trends and revenue streams and implement operating models to succeed in tomorrow’s market.

And for many this will mean upgrading their systems as necessary. So what does this mean for accountants?\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2><strong>Accountants in the firing line </strong></h2>\nAccounting teams remain particularly at risk and vulnerable to cyber extortion and potential attacks. And with current data showing that some 1.3 million computer systems still remain vulnerable to infection by the Wanna Cry virus – clearly the threat has yet to dissipate.\n\nWith the continued rise of the cloud for storing data and managing systems, the increase in BYOD (“bring your own device”) into the office and the increasingly sophisticated approach that cyber criminals are taking, there is no time to lose for accounting teams to ensure that their systems remain protected.\n<h2><strong>Re-assess the IT budget</strong></h2>\nThere will be a real need to re-assess IT budgets to see if they remain strategically aligned to the overall business objectives. Objectives that should now incorporate the ever growing threat posed by cyber-attacks and include necessary budget provision.\n\nClearly then, it will be crucial to ensure that the IT team is keeping the senior management team appraised of ongoing developments in the health of the IT systems as co-ordinated attacks across the global may occur at any time. IT and accounting teams will need to make a concerted effort to “speak the same language” as well as understand both side’s objectives, in an effort to closely manage the threat level.  And this means they need to work more closely together than ever before.\n<h2><strong>Preparing for the future</strong></h2>\nEmployers will increasingly be on the look for accountants who can not only demonstrate the ability to effectively communicate with the IT function, but who also have had exposure to data breach or a cyber-attack scenario in the past.  Consequently, candidates who possess an in-depth understanding of data security will be particularly sought after as employers place an ever greater focus on protecting their accounting systems.\n\nWhile none of us can predict the future, one thing is sure, this threat won’t be going away any time soon. It’s here to stay and while the doomsayers have been predicting an attack on this scale for some time, what Wanna Cry has shown us in the UK is the impact and chaos it can have on our everyday lives.

Slowly the figures are moving upwards as many companies do recognise the huge benefits that acting upon and championing the diversity agenda can bring.\n<h2><strong>Employers benefit by attracting the best candidates</strong></h2>\nFrom an employer’s perspective, the benefits of the new regulation is clear. By offering candidates the chance to compare rates of pay, provide transparency in pay scales, larger employers (those who will report) will be able to demonstrate by their willingness and ability to adhere to the new scheme. Their employment packages will be fairer, more open and ultimately with the additional bargaining power at their disposal, it will give the potential new recruit more opportunities.\n<h2><strong>Ensuring women’s careers remain on track</strong></h2>\nContinuing to tap into the knowledge and understanding that many women will have built up in their careers and which many, once they have had a family are still keen to develop is a no-brainer, but it continues to remain a challenge within the accountancy sector. However, flexible working, keeping in touch days and returning to work programmes are starting to play their part in ensuring that women’s hard-earned careers within accountancy remain on track as they progress through their working lives.\n\nThe bottom line – a term many accountants are wildly familiar with – is that the introduction of this new legislation is a win: win situation for all – candidates’ pay gets pushed up the negotiating ladder as more data is readily available; so recruiters and employers will continue to seek out and reward those who are best qualified and skilled at what they can offer.\n\nIt’s a fascinating journey that we’re all on and one where we’ve only just reached first base. As the recent CIMA’s 2016 <a href=\"http://salary.cimaglobal.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Salary Insights</a> report sponsored by GAN showed, the average rate of pay for UK qualified accountants was £63,991 versus £33,631 per annum for students. The question we need to ask is, what will these figures start to show once the new legislation comes into force as companies adapt and attempt to plug the gender pay gap? With a few companies already beginning to report their pay gap figures, we’re starting to see a new picture emerge.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YC10z1TlBdM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>If you're an accountant seeking a new role or an employer looking to boost your team, then maybe we should be <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/contact/\">talking</a>.

But what does this mean for accountants on the ground?\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2><strong>Authorities sign tax treaty</strong></h2>\nThe signing of this tax treaty is proof that the authorities have taken notice and acted upon the accusations of tax evasion that have been levelled against large corporates such as Google, Amazon and Apple, over the last few months.\n\nIt’s a big deal within the tax world, moving in on organisations which declare income via addresses in countries with favourable tax regimes. Such is its significance that the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, described it as “a turning point in tax treaty history”.\n\nFor businesses operating across different territories, the impact is clear, with a predicted 10% increase in tax take across the world, many companies may find their tax liabilities affected. But, like life itself, tax is a non-negotiable part and parcel of running a successful multi-jurisdictional business.\n\nWith the global tax management environment continuing to rapidly evolve, it is clear there has been a shift in focus. A recent <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/be/en/pages/tax/articles/global-research-bulletin.html\">Deloitte report,</a> summed up the crux of this evolution “from the 'what' of the global operating model to the ‘how’ of delivery through process improvement, greater automation and more effective use of technology.”\n<h2><strong>Skills required for a tax accountant</strong></h2>\nThis should come as no great surprise to tax accountants and finance professionals who are regularly used to upskilling themselves as they get to grips with the barrage of new pieces of tax regulation, legislation and other edicts, which continually fly off the regulative shelf.\n\nFor accountants on the ground it will be imperative, of course, that they comply with the requirements of the new tax treaty and take the opportunity it presents to ensure their people are up to speed.\n\nAs candidates and recruiters alike report, quite often, tax specialists will come to the job through different routes as they offer finance professionals a rewarding and challenging career path. And for those with a good technical understanding of the issues, it is easy to see why it remains an attractive career option to many.\n\nContrary to popular belief, tax accountants do need good communication and team working skills, as they seek to explain to any internal or external audience, including the Inland Revenue, the technical issues which remain of increased importance. And, as mentioned in the Deloitte report, the use of technology is becoming more significant than ever before.\n\nWith the introduction of this new corporate tax treaty aimed at businesses in over 70 countries, now more than ever professionals need to concentrate on keeping pace with the evolving regulatory landscape.\n\n<strong>If you're an accountancy professional looking for your next role or an employer looking to boost your team, then maybe we should be <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/contact/\">talking</a>.

What this amounts to is the recognition that good work and plentiful work can and should go together. Good work is something for which Government needs to be held accountable but for which we should all take responsibility. Businesses throughout the land are unlikely to disagree with any of these sentiments, however, what impact will the Taylor Review have on financial professionals and businesses within the sector?\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Taylor Review offers broader guidelines to businesses</h2>\nWhile the headlines have focused on the so called “gig economy”, and low skilled workers, for businesses, on the face of it there may be minimal impact. But there are some points worth pulling out that merit further attention.\n\nIn one of the seven guiding principles for fair and decent work, the Taylor Review suggests that, organisations should take a more proactive approach towards workplace health, given that “the shape and content of work and individual health and wellbeing are strongly related”.\n\nThis is interesting in the context of financial professionals, many of whom are used to working to deadlines and certainly as the year end approaches, under a certain amount of duress. The physical and emotional side effects of not dealing with the stress are well-known and employers should, as the Review suggests, take a proactive approach to managing anxiety levels, while doing everything they can to encourage employees to manage their own physical and emotional well-being.\n<h2>Increase in learning and development opportunities</h2>\nAnother of the guiding principles within the Review is that everyone should feel they have “realistically attainable ways to strengthen their future work prospects”, whether through formal learning or “on-the-job activities”. Training and development opportunities within the accountancy profession is an area I have touched on elsewhere, however, it remains a key driver in the way in which professionals are trained as many, but not all, aim for chartered status. The fact that there are so many different opportunities on offer means that businesses which employ in-house financial specialists should have a clear route to engaging with their employees and offering them the full suite of training opportunities, and ultimately enabling them to fulfil their professional capabilities.\n<h2>Impact of the Taylor Review on interim financial professionals</h2>\nThe Taylor Review says that “worker status should be renamed dependent contractor status and it should be made easier to distinguish between these individuals and those who are genuinely self-employed.”\n\nPutting aside the examples of Uber and Deliveroo, as far as accountants are concerned, the focus for many in this area is on well paid, highly-skilled professionals, who have chosen the contracting route rather than being a salaried employee. According to recent research from <a href=\"http://www.contractorcalculator.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contractor Calculator</a> “80% of self-employed high-end professionals, such as accountants, do not want rights or benefits so do not need any more onerous legislation that reduces the flexibility of the whole market simply to protect one sub-section”. For many financial professionals, their route to self-employment continues unabated, however, there may be barriers to this particular brand of employment, further down the line.\n\nFinally, the Taylor Review concludes that \"Everyone with an interest in a resilient and productive labour market has a role in ensuring better quality work. Government must play its role, but so must employers, business groups, trade unions, sector experts and others with particular knowledge and experience to deliver an economy based on a foundation of quality work.\" While this may not equate to a seismic revolution for accountants, there are some overriding principles that employers and professionals alike, must be both aware of, and take note of.\n\n<strong>For more insights visit the <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/how-to-prepare-for-interviews-more-effectively/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog section</a> of our website.</strong>\n\n&nbsp;", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/Impact-taylor-review-financial-professionals.png")},

  {title: "Are you concerned about access to talent post-Brexit?", description: "<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1518 alignleft\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Post-Brexit-2.png\" alt=\"access-to-talent-post-brexit\" />\nFor many business leaders, the uncertainty surrounding the exact nature of Brexit continues to hang in the air on a number of different levels with an exodus of talent being mooted across the board. A new survey from <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/global-markets/articles/power-up.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deloitte</a> finds that 36% of non-British workers based here are considering leaving the country in the next five years. Thus access to talent post-Brexit remains a burning issue for those engaged in hiring and accessing financial professionals. The dilemma of how their future recruitment policies will be affected, certainly in the short to medium term, continues to remain unclear.\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Brexit: pushing people out of the UK?</h2>\nOne report has estimated that <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/centre-for-london-report-on-brexit-70000-city-of-london-jobs-at-risk-2017-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70,000 jobs</a> would be lost in London if a hard Brexit deal was negotiated. Another study puts the figure at <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/19/london-to-lose-30000-high-paid-workers-as-a-result-of-brexit-6790884/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30,000</a>, so while the jury is still out on the exact ramifications, the omens don’t look great.\n\nFrom a skills perspective, the Deloitte survey also found that it’s the high-skilled EU workers that are most likely to leave with the survey quoting a figure of nearly half (47%) over the next five years.  So industries such as financial services, which rely on 5% of their employees coming from the EU, may experience significant difficulties as they struggle to fill the skills gap.\n\nThat is one of the many challenges that businesses face over the coming months and years. The other one that the Deloitte report puts forward as a hypothesis is that Brexit could be a catalyst for automation, which the accountancy profession is already experiencing.\n\nAs I have commented <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/why-accountants-need-to-be-embracing-automation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">elsewhere</a>, finance professionals are racing to upskill themselves to take on the new challenges within the profession as automation continues apace. However, in my view, there is still room for manoeuvre to become more of a trusted business adviser in the future.\n\nThe discussion around creating a <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/why-company-culture-matters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strong employer brand</a> also remains relevant to this debate. Without a strong employer brand in place, an employer that fails to create a supportive and engaging environment may see a downturn in their attraction and retention rates. In turn, this may lead to a fall in profitability and, Brexit or not, – a loss of staff – force even greater difficulties upon employers. In our experience, fostering a culture of shared values will certainly help build better employee relationships making them stronger and more productive, and as a result employees are less likely to leave the business.\n<h2>Access to talent post-Brexit: the UK remains an attractive place to work</h2>\nWhatever side of the fence you sit on, the outlook may not be as gloomy as some reports have suggested. The news from the Deloitte survey is that the UK continues to be seen as an attractive place to work and live, according to 89% of the respondents, ahead of destinations including the US, Australia and Canada. So for business leaders, while the future may not be orange, at least for the moment the signs are positive that access to talent should remain strong moving forward.\n\n<strong>If you’re an accountant seeking a new role or an employer looking to boost your team, then maybe we should be </strong><a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>talking</strong></a><strong>.

Measured by output per hour, productivity shrank 0.5% in the three months to March 2017, compared to the previous quarter. After no growth in almost a decade, this is a worrying time for the UK as it heads towards Brexit. So how are accountants’ productivity levels affected?\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIn financial services alone, output per hour has fallen on average by 0.6 per cent a year since 2009. The reasons behind this fall are complex and broadly relate to low investment in the UK, record high employment levels and the lack of best practice in management leading to flat levels of growth.\n<h2>Impact on accountants’ productivity levels</h2>\nSo what impact might this have on accountants? And how best can employers help lift the UK out of this productivity mire? One of the most effective ways of tackling this issue is through solid investment in <a href=\"http://2020projectmanagement.com/2016/02/the-importance-of-training-and-development-in-the-workplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">training and development</a> opportunities by HR teams. They offer employees a consistent experience and background knowledge of the environment they are operating in.\n\nIn the fast moving world of accountancy, this has never been more important. The automation of certain processes towards the more manual end of the market has meant that not only are there more opportunities opening up for accountants to move up the professional ladder, but also, there is a chance to become more skillful as they do so. Training, particularly in accountancy, is a given. With <a href=\"https://www.grb.uk.com/industries/accounting-graduate-career\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10% of all graduates picking accountancy</a> after university, it is a well-trodden route and the training programmes that the ‘Big Four’ firms offer are second to none.\n<h2>New professional opportunities are opening up</h2>\nHowever, different training options within the accountancy profession are opening up with the introduction of the Apprenticeship Levy in April this year and not just at entry level either. With the chance to take up the apprenticeship route, recruits can build their careers in accountancy while achieving a professional qualification and, at the end of the day, ensure their skills are up to date.\n\nWith higher apprenticeship levels on offer, up to degree level in finance and management, there are plenty of development opportunities to choose from for financial professionals.  On the ground, many employers have invested heavily in both time and money in their development and learning schemes, so they have every incentive to make them work. With organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/uk/en/careers/students/schools-opportunities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EY</a> offering apprenticeship schemes there are far greater opportunities for financial professionals to increase their skills and qualifications at the same time.\n<h2>Solving the ‘productivity puzzle’</h2>\nBringing the debate back to productivity levels to find an answer to the so called <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2017/968.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">productivity puzzle</a>, one could argue that it’s the responsibility of <strong>both</strong> accountants and their HR teams to ensure that team members are given the best chance to up-skill themselves even at the most senior levels. Accountancy is fortunate that it has a wide range of qualifications on offer. However, to play their part in boosting UK productivity levels, rather than sitting on their qualified laurels, so to speak, accountants need to keep one step ahead of the learning curve.

New research from <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/axa-research-reveals-that-global-workforces-are-still-vital-for-big-business-despite-economic-635811223.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AXA</a> reveals that more than a third (38%) of firms who responded to their survey said staff increasingly want to work abroad on short-term contracts and commute from their home country, leading to increased global mobility for qualified professionals.\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2>What are the benefits of global mobility for professionals?</h2>\nSo what are the benefits for those who might be considering a move abroad? Working internationally can lead to staff boosting their earnings and career prospects. AXA’s international research across 11 markets found that 98% of big businesses surveyed say a globally mobile workforce is important, with a third saying it is critical to their success. We recently helped one individual get a 40% pay increase and move to a 15% tax jurisdiction in one fell swoop. Not too shabby.\n\nSo while it’s clear that it’s a viable option for many large businesses, what should employees or potential candidates consider before committing to working overseas or looking for their perfect placement?\n\nRecruitment agencies, well good recruitment agencies at least, will have an important role to play in advising candidates on upcoming opportunities, but they will also act as a professional guide to help jobseekers navigate the financial, legal, cultural and practical challenges that working abroad can bring.\n\nAn experienced recruitment consultant will be able to advise on how relevant your domestic knowledge is in the international market, where you are able to work and if any additional qualifications or languages are required. They will also be in a good position to offer candid insight around how a placement overseas will impact your overall career trajectory. While a short term contract may provide a real boost to your CV, it is possible that, in some instances, that two years away can essentially mean that career development is put on hold until you re-enter the domestic market – something certainly worth considering.\n\nAlongside this, there are also the emotional and social implications of uprooting both professionals and their families. Having to contend with the local culture, climate and food may be trickier than expected, not to mention the logistics of managing an international move. Look carefully at what any proposed ex-pat relocation package provides. For example, accommodation, transport, flights back home, schooling for children, relocation allowances or health coverage.\n<h2>The rise of the ‘international commuter’</h2>\nOverseas professionals are increasingly seeking flexibility with three-quarters (75%) of employers from the AXA survey saying that people now want to commute internationally and continue living at home, in essence becoming an ‘international commuter’.\n\nThis is particularly understandable if employees are being seconded to roles which may involve living in single or married quarters in a compound environment in regions such as the UAE. Typically staff are very well looked after and the arrangement may include the use of a car and driver.\n\nSo while these opportunities might not suit everyone, for those who are looking for a fresh challenge, the opportunity of global mobility for professionals might be one to consider. The chance to move to another country and experience more variety in your work will undoubtedly put a different perspective on life. Add in the chance to enhance your CV and it might be too good a chance to miss.\n\n<strong>If you’re an accountancy professional looking for your next role or an employer looking to boost your team, then maybe we should be <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talking</a>.

But what is an appropriate dress code for accountants and others working in the sector?\n\nAccording to a recent <a href=\"https://www.cv-library.co.uk/recruitment-insight/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CVL_Dresscode.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> from online job board, CV-Library, less than one in three respondents (27%) working in accountancy feel that smart work-wear is outdated. Amongst IT professionals, by comparison, this figure stood at 54%. Within design, a whopping 69% believe strict dress codes have had their day.\n<h2>Social cues</h2>\nOf course different sectors have different expectations, but we cannot escape the fact that what we wear influences how others perceive us. In fact, just last year the Social Mobility Commission <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/01/candidates-miss-out-on-financial-jobs-because-they-wear-brown-sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that subtle social cues, such as wearing brown shoes with business attire, can scupper the chances of some candidates within the financial services sector who fail to fit the mould.\n<h2>Smart is subjective</h2>\nHowever, we must be mindful of the fact that the bar on what is judged to be ‘smart’ and therefore ‘acceptable’ is not only subjective but also a moving target. It was only in 2017, for example, that male MPs were no longer required to wear a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/29/male-mps-will-no-longer-forced-wear-ties-house-commons-speaker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tie in Parliament</a> – the break in convention was not welcomed by all, with some commentators voicing <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/mps-wearing-ties-clothing-regulations-john-bercow-peter-bone-tom-brake-a7815856.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">concerns</a> about the move reducing public respect for government.\n<h2>So what is a suitable dress code for accountants today?</h2>\nWe have written extensively on the need for accounting professionals to hone their networking skills, to get out into the company and build relationships, for finance to be immersed in the business. With that in mind, wear what your non-finance colleagues wear. Don’t be the finance bod in the suit if your stakeholders are in jeans and T-shirts, they’ll have written you off before you started talking. Be mindful of company culture and workday norms, mirroring and matching the people you want to build relationships with. Today, hardly any of the accounting professionals we work with wear suits or ties, but the vast majority look ‘smart’ in chinos, a skirt or smart jeans along with a shirt and shoes (even brown ones… or flat ones).\n\nBut for interviews, err on the side of overdressing, but within reason.

The level of business investment in the second quarter of this year was £43.8bn, adjusted for inflation — representing virtually <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daff3ffe-88ac-11e7-8bb1-5ba57d47eff7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no growth</a> quarter-on-quarter and meaning that it’s  the same as the three months before last year’s EU referendum.\n\nThese figures come after Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23fd12b2-783b-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> that persistent uncertainty over the UK’s future relationship with the EU was holding back business investment.\n<h2>Seeking efficiencies</h2>\nWith the uncertainty of Brexit on the horizon, it’s becoming increasingly important for senior accounting professionals to look for efficiencies in existing operations and recognise new revenue streams. High profile <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40397684\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cases</a> of financial institutions moving parts of their operations overseas exemplify how senior strategists are taking a proactive approach to reigning-in overheads to ensure they are better placed to weather any incoming storm. As such, accounting professionals who have experience in being able to identify potential pain points, and also effectively communicating suggested solutions to wider leadership teams, are becoming increasingly sought after. You want to be the one making recommendations that impact top or bottom line figures, who is coming up with the value adding ideas, who is proving to be an indispensable business partner.\n<h2>Accountants taking control of UK business investment</h2>\nMake no mistake, the UK economy remains strong. This data is not representative of businesses running out of cash – it’s the result of innately cautious accountants deciding to postpone investment while they ride out this period of uncertainty. And those who demonstrate they can do so effectively will have the welcome side effect of gaining valuable experience which will help them further their careers going forwards. Look for work, use your initiative and help your business flourish regardless of economic conditions.\n\n<strong>You can check out more insights by visiting the Global Accounting Network <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog homepage.</a></strong>\n\n&nbsp;", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/UK-Business-Investment.png")},
  {title: "Top 5 skills for future CFOs", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1542\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Top-5-skills-for-future-CFOs.png\" alt=\"Top 5 skills for future CFOs\" />\nThe role of Chief Financial Officer is coming out of the shadows. No longer playing Robin to the CEO’s Batman, the strength of a CFO is now widely recognised as being absolutely integral to a company’s strategy, direction and ultimate success.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHere are the top 5 skills for future CFOs:\n\n<strong>1. Technical skills</strong> – Advanced Excel is no longer enough. Today businesses are seeking Finance Directors who are at the bleeding edge of smart technologies, leveraging solutions such as cloud-enabled ERP systems. Many CFOs are now key players in driving adoption of these technologies - recent <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/gl/en/issues/managing-finance/ey-cfo-program-dna-of-the-cfo-part-2\">research</a> from EY found that 58% of CFOs believe combining state of the art technology with process improvement is crucial.\n\n<strong>2. Adaptability</strong> – CFOs who have spent time outside the finance function, in marketing or operations, for example, are becoming increasingly sought after by companies which value skills a traditional accountancy degree and a linear career path wouldn’t necessarily provide.    According to data from McKinsey, 31% of CFOs hired since 2009 have such experience, up from 17% of hired prior to 2009.\n\n<strong>3. Communication</strong> – Today’s CFOs must have the ability, and charisma, to engage with stakeholders both inside and outside of the business. As well as often being rolled-out as the face of the company in terms of investor relations, they’re no longer sat in a dusty corner wearing their pocket-protector working in silo day-to-day. According to <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/are-todays-cfos-ready-for-tomorrows-demands-on-finance\">McKinsey</a>, on average, five functions other than finance now report to the CFO.\n\n<strong>4. Leadership</strong> – McKinsey’s research also found that 72% of CFOs say they are significantly involved or the most involved executives in allocating employees and financial resources. As such, professionals must not only have the ability to manage the teams reporting into them, but also lead strategically.\n\n<strong>5. Creativity</strong> – The rise of automation within the finance function has placed a fresh emphasis on the importance of innately ‘human’ skills such as creativity. CEOs can prove their worth by finding innovative ways in applying data to achieve growth, particularly in sectors with frequent disruptions that require dramatic changes in resource\n\nOf course, desired skill sets depend heavily on the existing strengths of the rest of the top team – but there is no doubt that the CFO is morphing into a bigger, more challenging, role. KPMG’s The View from the Top <a href=\"http://ceo-monthly.com/2017-kpmg-reveals-nearly-a-third-of-global-ceos-feel-their-cfos-are-not-up-to-the-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> notes that almost two-thirds (63%) of CEOs from high-performing organisations believe that the CFOs role will increase in significance over the next 3 years.\n\nSenior finance professionals are metamorphosing from straight number crunchers to strategic advisors – and those aspiring towards CFO level, or looking for their next role, must recognise that expectations are shifting.\n\n<strong>You can check out our current vacancies on the Global Accounting Network <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website</a>.</strong>\n\n<strong>For more insights visit our blog <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homepage</a>.</strong>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/Top-5-skills-for-future-CFOs.png")},

But while being technically brilliant can get you so far in accountancy, only those with highly developed emotional intelligence will ever make it to the top.\n\nWe’ve previously blogged on the importance of <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/the-importance-of-soft-skills-in-accountancy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">soft skills</a> in accountancy. And this extends to being able to absorb and contextualise information from varied sources, rather than pinning pivotal decisions on a single cell on a spreadsheet.\n<h2>Striking the right balance</h2>\n‘Shrinkflation’ and ‘decontenting’ are now default solutions to maintaining profit or increasing margins without hiking prices. But striking the right balance relies on a different kind of business savvy. Essentially, knowing how far you can cut to the bone before perceived brand value drops in the eyes of employees, customers or other stakeholders is vital. And in an age when technology is taking greater responsibility for crunching the numbers, human intuition is a valuable commodity.\n<h2>Looking beyond the figures</h2>\nThe <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/the-rise-of-ai-in-accountancy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rise of AI</a> in accountancy means that the clients we work with are increasingly seeking CFOs and other senior leaders who can take a holistic, measured, ‘human’ perspective on change. Those who can demonstrate an ability to look beyond the figures and sign-off decisions which boost profits, without inciting public outrage, stand the best chance of success.\n\n<strong>You can check out our current vacancies on the Global Accounting Network <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website.</a></strong>\n\n<strong>For more insights visit our blog <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homepage.</a></strong>\n\n&nbsp;", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/Beyond-the-figures.png")},

CFOs are optimistic – and we’re not surprised.\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Uncertainty down</h2>\nAccording to Deloitte’s latest <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/deloitte-cfo-survey-q3-2017.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFO Survey</a>, 27% of respondents say they are more optimistic about the prospects for their company than they were three months ago, up from 18% in Q2. The number of finance chiefs claiming that the level of uncertainty facing their business is ‘high’, meanwhile, has dropped from almost half (42%) to just a third (34%).\n\nLast month we outlined the <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/top-5-skills-future-cfos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top five skills for future CFOs</a> – and number two on the list was adaptability. Finance professionals who can challenge a changeable business environment head on, and come out fighting, are an invaluable asset for any business. The clients we work with seek accounting professionals who can demonstrate that they use initiative to help their business flourish, regardless of economic conditions.\n<h2>A stronger footing</h2>\nYes, Brexit continues to be seen as the number one risk factor. But savvy finance heads are planning accordingly to minimise disruption. Deloitte’s data, for example, found that reducing costs remains the top priority, with 41% citing this as a key focus.\n\nWe recently highlighted that, although <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/accountant-uk-business-investment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business capital spending remains flat</a>, this is representative of finance chiefs deciding to postpone investment while they ride out this period of uncertainty, rather than being indicative of businesses running out of cash. And it seems that those who battened down the hatches to weather the storm are already beginning to emerge on a stronger footing.\n<h2>CFOs optimistic</h2>\nDeloitte’s figures show that 22% of CFOs say they expect businesses to increase capital spending in the coming 12 months, up from 14% last quarter. The future may be uncertain, but thanks to shrewd senior accounting professionals, businesses are confident that they can ride the wave.\n\n<strong>You can check out our current vacancies on the Global Accounting Network <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/vacancies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website</a>.</strong>\n\n<strong>For more insights visit our blog <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homepage</a>.</strong>", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/CFOs-optimistic.png")},
  {title: "Why achieving true productivity in accountancy isn’t the same as being an overtime hero", description: "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1564\" src=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/true-productivity-in-accountancy.png\" alt=\"true productivity in accountancy\" />\n\nAccording to new <a href=\"http://economia.icaew.com/en/news/september-2017/accountants-work-too-much-study-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data</a> from CV Library, accountants are putting in too much overtime, with one in 10 working seven days a week. Almost half of those surveyed (45.7%) put in more than 13 extra days a year, while two-thirds said they worked more hours than their contracts required. But we shouldn’t confuse presenteeism with productivity.\n\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Hero culture</h2>\nTechnology has facilitated an ‘always on’ culture which is increasingly revered in the modern workplace. Employees are habitually celebrated for getting back to emails at 4:30 am, dragging themselves into work with gastroenteritis or proclaiming they <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-only-need-holiday-dont-love-your-job-adrian-o-connor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">love their job too much to take a summer holiday</a>. However the prevalence of ‘hero culture’ isn’t necessarily good for business.\n<h2>True productivity in accountancy</h2>\nThere’s a myriad of evidence which suggests that ‘overwork’ leads to a decrease in output. Stamford University recently <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/crunchmode/econ-hours-productivity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">calculated</a> that that productivity during a 60 hour week is typically less than two-thirds that of a 40 hour week. While a separate <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> from Boston University’s Questrom School of Business found managers could not tell the difference between the output of employees who actually worked 80 hours a week and those who just pretended to. Managers did penalise employees who were transparent about working less – but there was no evidence that those individuals actually accomplished less, or, for that matter, any sign that the overworking staff accomplished more.\n<h2>Working smart</h2>\nI’m a firm advocate of the benefits of hard work. But putting in the hours and working smart aren’t necessarily one and the same. Of course you’ll need to burn the midnight oil during times of increased demand and seven-day weeks are often essential to make it over the line at year-end. But measuring your own, or your employees’, success solely on ‘hours clocked’ rather than tangible outcomes is foolish.\n\nIf you’re consistently working seven-day weeks just to keep your head above water, the chances are this is indicative of either broken processes or your own ineptitude. Take a step back from the grindstone and plough your energy identifying and implementing more efficient ways of working.\n\nIf that approach isn’t successful, talented accounting professionals should seek out an employer who recognises that great performance equates to more than just being the first one in and the last one out. Success should be measured on how you impact the company’s bottom line – and while overtime may be a contributing factor, it shouldn’t be the deciding factor.\n\n<strong>View our latest <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/vacancies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accounting and finance vacancies </a></strong>\n\n<strong>For more insights visit our <a href=\"http://globalaccountingnetwork.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog homepage</a></strong>\n\n&nbsp;", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: open(Rails.root + "articles_import_data/true-productivity-in-accountancy.png")},

  {title: "10 common Interview Mistakes", description: "<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">The best interviewee is not always the best candidate. Yep, I said it. Sometimes the best candidate gets usurped by the best interviewee because interviewing is a skill and not one all candidates possess. As a recruiter of many, many years’ experience I have seen the full gamut of interview successes and failures. Here is a selection of the most common interview mistakes.</span><!--more--></span></h5>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Poor research:</span> </strong>No excuse for this one and it’s unforgivable. I am not ashamed to say there is a trail of lazy recruiters in my past that didn’t get past the first 10 minutes of interview because of lack of research. If you want the job, fight for it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Weak handshake: </strong></span>I’m not suggesting that candidates get or lose jobs based on the power of their grip, but it’s not a great first impression if, as they clasp you firmly, it feels like they have a post-rigor carp in their mitt.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Poor eye contact:</strong></span> Another basic one but one that people forget. Don’t glare like you’re in a primary school staring contest, but do maintain eye contact and good non-verbal communications.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Don’t know your own CV:</strong> </span>You wrote it. Or you should have done. If you wrote it, please revise the content, reflect on the achievements, know the content by heart. If an agency revised it, make sure they sent it to you. Nothing worse than being asked about something you’ve never seen.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Poor examples:</strong></span> Hopefully you have seen the job spec in plenty of time. Pick the most relevant examples from your career and prepare them in advance. Practice them. Associate a tangible result or benefit to the business with them. We’ve all left interviews kicking ourselves because we should have answered something differently.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Rambling:</strong></span> Nerves are a terrible affliction. We all get them, particularly if we really want the job. When asked a question, don’t be afraid to take a moment to prepare your answer, refer back to the question, stay close to the point. If you think you rambled, ask “does that answer your question?”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Over confidence: </strong></span>If an interviewer is good, they will expect there to be parts of the job that you haven’t covered, elements from your work history that are weaker than others. Acknowledge them and explain how you would overcome them, rather than fudge over them.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Not asking good questions:</strong></span> Some people can rattle off good questions in an interview situation, others need to prepare them in advance. Interviewers always expect them. It’s always good to show preparation by starting questions with “Through my research I noticed that…? Or “As I read your quarterly results I wondered why…?”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Not showing enthusiasm:</strong></span> It’s been said, mostly by me, that sales is a transfer of enthusiasm. You are selling yourself as a future business partner to the interviewer and someone who really wants the job. Tread the line between enthusiastic interviewee and over-excited puppy carefully but show enthusiasm. It’s okay to tell them you really like the opportunity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Not covering off any concerns:</strong></span> Unless you have absolutely nailed it, there are likely to be areas you could have done better. Don’t be afraid to ask “Is there anything you would like me to re-cover?” or “Based on this interview, do you have any concerns about my suitability?”</span>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; color: #800000;\">Not an exhaustive list, but a list of common mistakes and worth thinking about even for the most seasoned interviewees.

  {title: "The Joys of an Ever-Shifting Job Market", description: "Say what you like about Recruitment Consultants, and I am sure many of you do, they are close to the forefront of changes in the economy. There are few better barometers as to how the world is feeling about the economic situation than the extent, speed, volume and blend of hiring, and Recruiters feel it first. How they deal with it is the measure of their mettle.<!--more-->\n\nWe have just experienced 7 years of stagnation and recession in the economy. Many candidates and hiring managers have never known anything other than a job-short “buyer’s market”. As the market shifts, and shift is has, the dynamics change significantly and rapidly which makes securing the best talent far more challenging, and often makes the candidates choices harder too. Can you rely on your Recruitment Consultant to help guide you through the changing landscape?\n\nIn reality you should be able to – that is, after all, their job. However, the answer will vary from Recruiter to Recruiter and from firm to firm.\n\nLike candidates and hiring managers, the bulk of Recruitment Consultants operating at desk level today will probably have learned recruitment in a recession, or have entered the industry so recently that their knowledge is sparse. Succeeding as a Recruiter in a recession is no mean feat and if they survived it they are probably pretty determined and pretty good. However, the shift in dynamics requires different skills.\n\nWe aren’t totally in the bull market but we are getting there. The volume of vacancies is increasing, candidates have more options, there is more competition for top talent, and top employees are also experiencing more positive moves in their own companies. Counter-offers are on the up with some candidates getting 20-40% pay rises to stay put. Have hiring managers, candidates and recruiters responded appropriately?\n<h2>Hiring Managers</h2>\nOnce again, speed is of the essence. You probably have multiple candidates who look good on paper. You may have met several that you like. I guarantee the best of them is also the favourite for your competition. Act – don’t delay.\n\nMake sure the interview process is a two-way sell. Candidates are picky and rightly so. They are making a big commitment and they have choices. Find out from your Recruitment Consultant what the candidate is looking for and show how your role fulfills the brief. Think how hard it would (hopefully) be to tempt your top employee away. – that’s the calibre you are targeting.\n\nPay people what they are worth. The days of people taking a sideways or backwards move to secure a good role are behind us. If a candidate’s value to market is greater than their value to you, you will lose them. If you want them, be competitive. It’s really hard to undo the negative impact of a low-balled offer.\n\nWork with your Recruiter to secure the candidate you want. If the Recruiter is good, they will have an honest and open rapport with the candidates and will help you avoid losing them. If your recruiter can’t offer that, change them. We aren’t exactly in short supply!\n<h2>Recruiters</h2>\nRevel in the growth in the market. Enjoy the fact that you can now pick up jobs more easily, that your pipeline is strong and that you are busy. Hone the skills you developed in the recession.\n\nHowever, don’t get lazy. Fulfilling your client’s brief just became much, much harder. Your best candidates now have three times as many options, including internally. You need to really understand their needs and really deliver for them or your clients will miss out. Help your clients understand the market dynamics, help your candidates make the right choices, be consultative. The right candidate, for the right job, at the right price. It will pay off.", tags: nil, admin_user_id: 1, subtitle: nil, image: nil}
